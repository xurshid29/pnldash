# Session Handover — updated 2026-10-03

A running handover so a fresh session can continue without re-deriving context.
**Read START HERE below first** — it is the current state in one place.
`docs/web-dashboard.md` is the longer feature/status doc; this file is the
"where we are right now + what's open" layer on top of it.
**`docs/detection-layers.md` is the systematic reference for the early-
detection chain** (📰/🤫/📈/👀/🛰️ — how each layer works, knobs, grading SQL).
Memory files under `…/memory/` also carry the durable facts.

## START HERE — state at 2026-10-03 (last code commit `d50ebbe`)

**The desk the operator actually uses.** The Momentum table (Finviz, every
20s) sorted by the **A+…D grade**, plus the History, Watchlist and Alerts
tabs, Quote Details, the news room and 0–4 TradingView charts. Manual
trading off 1-minute charts, Ross-Cameron-style selection: catalyst first,
low float, mostly 07:00–11:00 ET. **The operator's current entry (since
~10-01): the VWAP/BB setup** — a session top gainer under its month-anchored
VWAP while the BB basis (SMA 20) curls up within ~6% beneath it; exits fast
when it fails (📐, item 5 below). Everything else is parked (below). Prod
`/health` ok; ~0.8 GB of 3.9 GB RAM used (was ~3 GB + swap before the
parking), disk 26%.

**Live in production (all verified on prod):**
1. **Momentum grade A+…D** (`services/momentum-grade.ts`). Fitted on
   August, validated out-of-sample on September, per displayed cycle. Label:
   price touches +10% within 30 min. 2-minute smoothing; the table's default
   sort; persisted per row (`screener_results.grade` / `grade_score`).
   **Fade cap:** an A-tier name ≥8% below its 10-minute high shows **B+ ▼N**
   until it recovers. **Read A+ as "where the action is", not a long
   signal** — at A+, −10% comes first 29.8% vs +10% first 25.0%; from A down,
   up-first wins.
2. **Opportunity alerts** (`services/opportunity-alerts.ts`): 🅰️ first A+
   per ticker per ET day · ⚡ +10% vs ~60s ago with RVol 1m ≥1000%, on screen
   ≥5 min, 15-min cooldown · 📰 headline published ≤30 min before first
   sight, deduped across sources; the phone only gets catalyst ≥40. ONE
   engine feeds Telegram and `payload.alerts`. Sized ≈63 phone alerts/day;
   10-02 had 33 by midday (17 A+, 13 news, 3 fast). Dashboard: sound +
   browser notification, in-page toast (`AlertToasts`), row pulse ~90s then a
   colored left edge for 15 min, 🅰️⚡📰 badges, and the **Alerts** tab
   (`GET /api/screener/alerts`). Switches: header ⚙ per-type menu + Alerts
   ON/OFF (dashboard); `ALERTS_DISABLED` slugs `grade_aplus` / `fast_move` /
   `news` (phone).
3. **UI state:** no hover tooltips anywhere (global `.ant-tooltip` hide in
   `index.css` + native `title=` removed — **don't add hover hints back**);
   no left rail (Watchlist is a tab; the rail only renders if Ignition or
   Live Ticks is re-enabled); Momentum columns: Ticker · Grade · Heat · Chg% ·
   Float · Volume · RVol 1m · RVol 5m · RVol Day · Price · MCap · Country ·
   Appeared.
4. **CI rollout runs `dbmate up` BEFORE `docker compose up -d`** (fixed
   10-01). The old API briefly runs on the new schema, so keep migrations
   additive.
5. **📐 TradingView VWAP setups (2026-10-03)** — the operator's edge,
   detected by TradingView (we can't compute a month VWAP with pre-market
   volume ourselves). Pine script `apps/web/src/tv/mvwap-bb-setup.pine`
   (**v3**) runs as TWO watchlist alerts, 1m and 2m (Premium = 2), and
   posts FORMING → READY → GO to `POST /api/tv/webhook?key=…`; each signal is
   a `tier_events` row (tier `alert`, event `tv_setup`), an SSE `alert`
   event (toast + sound at once), a 📐 row badge, the **📐 VWAP setups** tab
   (stage trail per ticker, Copy list / Download .txt / Copy Pine script /
   How to) and Telegram (`ALERTS_DISABLED` `tv_setup` or `tv_forming` /
   `tv_ready` / `tv_go`). **Full reference: `docs/vwap-setup.md`** (Pine
   walkthrough, tuning table, change procedure, grading SQL, backlog).

**Parked, code kept** — `COMPONENTS_DISABLED` default
`ignition,momo,setups,ema,swing,outcomes,continuation,edge,vwap,ticks`:
every experiment, including Edge (08-21), ↑ VWAP reclaim (08-22, graded as
noise) and **Live Ticks / Databento** (10-01). The feed had been dead since
~09-12 without anyone noticing (unpaid renewal); the key is commented out
and the **subscription is cancelled** (operator confirmed 2026-10-02).
Reviving Live Ticks would need a new paid subscription. Paid APIs
parked: Benzinga and Anthropic (keys commented out). No OpenAI key, so
catalyst classification is rules-only. News = Finviz + Yahoo + SEC + halts.

**Prod `.env` snapshot (10-02):** `COMPONENTS_DISABLED` unset (= the
default above); `ALERTS_DISABLED=momentum,ignition,new_ignition,fresh_burst,
accum,tick_watch,radar,dual_signal,swing,vwap_reclaim` (so `grade_aplus`,
`fast_move`, `news` are on; `tick_catch` is unmuted but has no producer);
`TICKFEED_ENABLED=true` but inert. `TV_WEBHOOK_SECRET` set 10-03 (the
webhook key; the full URL was given to the operator). Backups:
`.env.bak-20260821`, `.env.bak-20260821b`, `.env.bak-20261001`,
`.env.bak-20261003`.

**Open items, ranked:**
0. **Mon 2026-10-05 — first live session of the 📐 setup.** The operator
   sets up the TradingView side over the weekend (script on a chart, check
   its yellow line sits on their "VWAP Month"; runners watchlist; one
   watchlist alert with the webhook). Confirm signals arrive
   (`docker compose … logs api | grep tv-setup`, or the 📐 tab), then tune
   the Pine inputs with the operator (bar replay on past days, including
   names that failed). Nothing has measured the edge yet — the evidence is
   six hand-picked top gainers; the 2026-08 session-VWAP reclaim layer
   graded as noise. **~2026-10-17: grade the `tv_setup` rows** (SQL in
   `docs/vwap-setup.md` §9). Ask the operator to import a fresh IBKR .tlg (the
   journal stops at 06-18) so their real P&L on these trades can be checked.
1. **~2026-10-15 — re-grade the LIVE grade** from `screener_results.grade`
   with the same label and the first-touch race. Does it hold live? Pipeline:
   `apps/api/scripts/research/momentum-grade/` (export SQL → `study.py` →
   `verify-momentum-grade.ts` parity). Re-fit there; never hand-edit
   POINTS/CUTS.
2. **~2026-10-15 — grade the alerts** (`tier_events` tier='alert'; meta has
   the alert id, price, grade, kind details): continuation after each kind,
   then review the volume with the operator. Dials: the +10% fast threshold,
   cooldowns, the news phone floor — `alert_study.py` re-measures them.
3. **Noise is the failure mode.** The operator muted alerts for noise twice
   before (07-22, 08-21). Treat "too many pings" as a tuning request.
4. Same-ticker alerts in consecutive cycles are not merged (FLUX on 10-02:
   A+ and a headline 20s apart = two toasts). Add a cross-cycle merge window
   if it annoys.
5. Candidate, not built: Ross's exit tell, the 1-minute MACD turning
   negative, as a live feature/alert. Finviz gives 20s snapshots, not 1m
   candles, so it needs 1m bars built from cycles or a data source.
6. Long-open: Trade Journal attribution — join trades to the grade/rows at
   entry time; more interesting now that grades persist.

**Gotchas before touching things:**
- A deploy resets in-memory state. Seeded on boot: firstSeen, VWAP, the
  fade-cap price history (last 10 min), alert dedup (tier_events +
  24h news URLs). Not seeded: the 6-cycle grade smoothing ring, which
  refills in 2 min.
- In after-hours, a row's change % is the AH overlay (vs today's close), and
  the grade reads it as-is; the AH time bucket carries a penalty.
- Research exports are not in the repo; re-export with the `export-*.sql`
  files outside 07:00–11:00 ET. In study SQL, `dd10` is already the
  "−10% within 30 min" label column — a same-named feature silently shadows
  it (cost an hour on 10-01).
- The droplet's `git pull` once failed mid-deploy with "expected flush
  after ref listing" (a GitHub HTTPS hiccup); rerunning the deploy job fixed
  it.
- Verify UI deploys by matching the bundle hash
  (`apps/web/dist/assets/index-*.js` vs `/usr/share/nginx/html/assets/` in
  the web container), not by CI status alone.

## Session log 2026-10-01 → 10-03 (newest first)

These are the detailed notes behind START HERE, kept verbatim.

**2026-10-03 (evening) — 📐 SCRIPT v3.** The operator asked why AMOD showed
nothing around 02:30 UTC+5 (17:30 ET, after hours). AMOD fell 24% on 10-01,
then ran +70% after hours. Its day high vs the prior close was +19.8% on
TradingView's bars (Yahoo's say +20.1%), so the 20% gate stayed shut. v3 adds
`useAhGain`: after hours, the high since today's close also counts, like
Finviz's AH change. The alert window default becomes 04:00–20:00 (the operator
had set 0015-2345 by hand; the field is New York time). The message gains
`ah ±N%` and writes negative day highs properly. Replay with AMOD as the 7th
example: v3 catches 6/7 (1m) and 7/7 (2m); AMOD READY 17:08 / 17:30 ET.
The replica gained a `trace=` hook for "why didn't it fire" questions.

**2026-10-03 (later) — 📐 SCRIPT v2.** The operator replayed v1 on MEDS (1m)
and it missed the 09-18 07:00 ET move. Diagnosis with an offline replica of the
script (it reproduced v1's markers on their chart): (1) the today-only +20%
gate. MEDS closed 09-17 at 4.60 and was −2% pre-market, a 3rd-day runner.
(2) A fast approach: price 9.9% → 2.8% under the line while the 20-bar basis
lagged 12–13% under, outside FORMING's 10%. Settings alone topped out at 4/6
with ~2× noise and still missed MEDS. v2 adds `runnerDays` 2, a fast-approach
route (price-led, `path fast`), an alert window 04:00–16:00 NY, and
`maxCycles` 4; run it on 1m AND 2m (NXL only exists on 2m — the 1m basis was
already above the line). Replay on the six examples: v1 2/6 (1m) and 3/6 (2m);
v2 5/6 and 6/6; other signals 4/5 → 8/9. Tool:
`apps/api/scripts/research/vwap-setup/` (`python3 replay.py`). Full
write-up: `docs/vwap-setup.md` §3, §5, §12. The operator must paste v2 and
recreate both alerts.

**2026-10-03 — 📐 TRADINGVIEW VWAP SETUP (the operator's edge, wired in).**
Operator described the edge they trade since ~10-01: a session top gainer
(per the operator: it need not be A+ at the entry) under TradingView's month-anchored
VWAP (yellow) while the BB basis (SMA 20, green) curls up 5–6% below it,
often after a first VWAP test was rejected; MACD as confirmation; 1m/30s
charts; quick exits. Findings from the first look: at the entry the grade
was usually not A+ (AIXI showed B+ through its 07:56–08:05 ET pullback —
first the fade cap, then a cooling score; VEEA A/A−), all six examples had
been on our screen in the prior 2–3 weeks, the month anchor equals the
session VWAP on the 1st (NXL/VEEA 10-01), and Yahoo's pre/post bars have
ZERO volume (1m and 2m) — so neither Yahoo nor our snapshots can reproduce
the operator's line (AIXI 10-02 close: Yahoo-RTH 1.81 vs TV 1.77; the BB
basis matched to the cent, 1.63). Operator asked about a headless browser +
screenshots + LLM to watch more charts; advised against it (an LLM reading
line distances is the least precise step, scraping TradingView is against
its terms, and it's slow) in favour of letting TradingView run the rule:
Pine v6 script + one watchlist alert → webhook. Built: `routes/tv.ts`
(webhook with key + dry run, runners watchlist export), `services/
tv-setups.ts` (message parser, dup/flood gate, Telegram format),
`poller.deliverTvSetup` (tier_events + payload.alerts + SSE `alert` +
Telegram), a 4th alert kind `tv_setup` across the dashboard (Alerts filter,
toast, stage-aware sounds, ⚙ switch, row badge 📐, cyan row edge) and the
📐 VWAP setups tab. Regression `scripts/verify-tv-setups.ts` (39 checks incl.
the .pine ↔ parser contract). Prod `.env`: `TV_WEBHOOK_SECRET` added.
Then documented it end to end in **`docs/vwap-setup.md`** (definition,
evidence, findings, design decisions, Pine walkthrough + tuning table, the
change procedure, grading SQL, backlog, changelog); the script now carries a
version line (v1) that the changelog tracks.

**2026-10-02 — ALERTS VISIBLE ON THE DASHBOARD.** New **Alerts** tab with
the day's log (`GET /api/screener/alerts`, regrouped from tier_events
tier='alert'; meta now carries the alert `id`/`at`, older rows regroup by
ticker within 3s), filter by kind, price/grade at alert and a live "since
alert" %, click = select; Momentum rows that alerted in the last 15 min
show 🅰️/⚡/📰 badges by the ticker, pulse ~90s after the alert, then keep
a colored left edge for 15 min; each new alert also opens an in-page toast
(`components/dashboard/AlertToasts.tsx`, same switches as the sound).

**2026-10-01 (evening) — GRADE FADE CAP.** Operator spotted LONA graded A+
right after dumping ~20% off its high (MACD rolling over). Root cause: the
grade's label (+10% touch within 30 min) REWARDS a dump — the bounce off the
low counts — and a falling tick even earned more points than a slow rise.
Measured on the +10%-vs-−10% first-touch race for A-tier names by distance
below the 10-min high: up:down 1.11/1.25 (Aug/Sep) near the high, flipping
below 1 from 8% off (0.95/0.90 at 8–12%, 0.84/0.88 at 12–20%). It is not
the last minute's speed (just-dropped names ≈1.04) — it is having faded from
the recent high. Rule (GRADE_FADE): A-tier ≥8% below its 10-min high shows
**B+ ▼N** until it recovers or the window rolls past the old high; Sep
A-tier up:down 1.12 → 1.19 at 11.1% → 9.7% of rows. A capped name cannot
fire the 🅰️ alert. Parity incl. the cap 201,981/201,981 (4,476 capped
rows). Study: `scripts/research/momentum-grade/fade_study.py`.

**2026-10-01 (latest) — OPPORTUNITY ALERTS LIVE (phone + dashboard).**
Operator asked to be notified on any opportunity: new A+, lower grade →
A+, an existing ticker moving fast, new news. Built as ONE server engine
(`services/opportunity-alerts.ts`) whose per-cycle output goes to Telegram
AND the dashboard (`payload.alerts`), so they can't disagree. Rules were
sized on September (out-of-sample), not guessed: A+ every-entry would be
162/day (smoothing flicker) → **first A+ per ticker per day** (26/day, and
the best moment: +10% within 30 min 38% vs 3% base); fast move = **+10%
vs ~60s ago, RVol 1m ≥1000%, on screen ≥5 min, 15-min cooldown** (~31/day,
44% continue +10% — but −10% comes first 50%); news = **headline published
≤30 min before first sight** on a screened ticker (74% of first-seen
headlines are OLD news found when a ticker appears), deduped by URL + title
across sources; phone only catalyst ≥40. Combined ≈63 phone alerts/day,
busiest hour 09:00 ET ≈10. Same-ticker events in one cycle merge into one
message. Dedup is DB-seeded on boot (tier_events tier='alert' + last-24h
news URLs) — no re-pings after deploys; every alert kind is a tier_events
row for later grading. Mutes: phone = `ALERTS_DISABLED` slugs
`grade_aplus`/`fast_move`/`news`; dashboard = per-type switches next to
Alerts ON/OFF. The old `momentum` fresh-catalyst push stays muted (📰
supersedes it). Regression: `scripts/verify-opportunity-alerts.ts` (27
checks); replay of two September sessions reproduced the study's A+ count
exactly (25/25). **Next:** after ~2 weeks, grade `tier='alert'` rows
(continuation after each kind) and re-tune volume with the operator.

**2026-10-01 (later) — LIVE TICKS RETIRED, DATABENTO BEING CANCELLED.**
Found while shipping the grade: every tick-feed-sourced tier_event stopped
after Fri 2026-09-11 — the Databento feed had been dead for three weeks
(unpaid renewal around the 12th, as on 08-12) and nobody noticed; the
operator uses only Momentum + History. So Live Ticks joined the parked set
(new `ticks` slug in the `COMPONENTS_DISABLED` default): no sidecar, no
Databento connection, no 🤫 scan, no ladder, no tier_events for
accum/tick, empty `tick_catches`. The left rail is gone by default (it only
renders while Ignition or Live Ticks is on); the Watchlist moved into the
screener tabs (Momentum · History · Watchlist).
Prod `.env`: `DATABENTO_API_KEY` commented out (key presence can no longer
bill anything). **Telegram is now silent** — the 🛰️ confirm was the last
unmuted alert with a producer. Candidates if the operator wants pings back:
unmute `momentum` (fresh-news strong/major catalyst rows) or a new
first-time-grade-A ping. Operator cancels the subscription in the Databento
portal; the unpaid September invoice may still be owed. Default desk now:
**Momentum (A+…D grade, default sort) + Momentum History**, all Finviz.

**2026-10-01 — MOMENTUM LETTER GRADE (A+ … D) LIVE + CI MIGRATIONS-FIRST
(see XGRADE below).** Every Momentum row carries a letter grade, re-graded
each cycle and smoothed over 2 minutes; the Momentum table's new Grade
column is the DEFAULT SORT (Heat stays as a clickable column). Fitted, not
hand-weighted: inspired by a Ross Cameron 5-criteria video, but his
criteria were tested on our data first — change %, time of day (07:00–11:00
ET best, after-hours worst), catalyst (strong 40–69 beats "major" ≥70) and
float carry signal; his $2–20 price band and day-RVol ≥5× do NOT inside our
screen. Live tape activity (acceleration, 1m/5m burst, idle tape) dominates.
Fit Aug / test Sep, out-of-sample P(+10% within 30 min): A+ 26.8% … D 0.1%;
A-tier 17.2% vs Heat top-12% 13.5%. **Read A+ as "where the action is", not
a long signal**: within 30 min A+ hits −10% first 29.8% vs +10% first
25.0%; from A downward up-first wins (A 17.8/15.2, A− 11.0/6.5, B+ 7.3/3.1).
Grade + score persist per row (`screener_results.grade/grade_score`) so the
LIVE grade can be re-graded the same way after ~2 weeks. Also: the CI
rollout now runs `dbmate up` BEFORE `docker compose up -d` (the deploy-order
gotcha that broke Edge's first rollout is closed) — keep migrations additive.

## Earlier context — superseded, kept for reference

> Everything in this section describes the desk BEFORE 2026-10-01: Edge
> live, the MOMO/EMA/reclaim layers, Live Ticks. All of those are parked
> now, and **"THE PENDING TASK" below (the 08-12 reclaim grading
> checkpoint) is obsolete** — the reclaim layer is parked. Use START HERE
> for the current state.

**UPDATE 2026-08-21 (later the same day): Edge PARKED.** The operator stopped
using the ⚡ Edge playbook, so it joined the `COMPONENTS_DISABLED` set (new
`edge` slug, in the default). Effect: `EdgeService` does not start (no preset
load, no `edge_bars_1m` writes, no `edge_events`, no Telegram `edge_*`
pushes), `/api/edge` answers 503, the web hides the tab and stops polling.
Tables + code stay intact; re-enable by removing `edge` from the env var.
Default desk is now **🛰️ Live Ticks, Momentum, Momentum History**. The Edge
narrative below is retained as history.

**2026-08-22 — ↑ VWAP RECLAIM RETIRED + 🤫 ACCUM ROWS HIDDEN (noise
reduction, operator's call).** One graded session said the VWAP layer was
noise: 48 reclaims → 41 "confirms" (85%) → 31 lost, median hold 10 min,
median peak +1.2% above VWAP, 9/31 lost within 5 min of confirming, every
anchor partial (two deploys). Parked via a new `vwap` slug in the
`COMPONENTS_DISABLED` default: the tracker does not run, no rows, no
tier_events, dashboard flags off; code + regression kept (see
detection-layers ↑ section for the revisit recipe). Separately the 🤫 accum
rows are no longer listed in LIVE TICKS (`TICK_LIST_HIDE_ACCUM` in
poller.ts) — pending 👀 and confirmed 🛰️ only; accum detection, its
👀-promotion path and `tier='accum'` grading are unchanged. Alert posture
stays: Telegram + dashboard = 🛰️ LIVE TICK CONFIRMED only.

**ALERTS REVIEW + ↑ VWAP RECLAIM LAYER (2026-08-21, same session — see XVWAP
below).** Finding: NOTHING alerted because every slug with a live producer
was muted in the prod `.env` (`ALERTS_DISABLED=momentum,ignition,
new_ignition,fresh_burst,accum,tick_watch,tick_catch,radar,dual_signal,
swing`) and the only unmuted slugs (`ema_*`, `edge_*`) belong to parked
components. Operator's call: alert when a new Live Tick appears → prod
`.env` UNMUTES `tick_catch` (Telegram 🛰️ LIVE TICK CONFIRMED, once per
ticker per day) and the dashboard's 🛰️ sound is back on. `tick_watch` (👀)
was un-muted for ~2 hours then re-muted the same morning — operator wants
the CONFIRMED tier only, both phone and dashboard. New ↑ VWAP
reclaim layer: session-VWAP cross-and-hold on closed 1m candles, listed
under LIVE TICKS, graded as `tier='vwap'`, Telegram slug `vwap_reclaim`
added to ALERTS_DISABLED until graded. `momentum` (fresh-news catalyst
pushes) stays muted — operator didn't ask; it is the one-line unmute if
they want news pings back.

**CURRENT FOCUS (2026-08-21, superseded above for Edge): lean manual-playbook desk + Edge live in production.** After testing the
automated experiments, the operator's successful workflow is: watch the
current session's top movers on 1-minute charts; configure the EMA pair per
ticker as dynamic support/resistance; wait for a pullback/bounce at an EMA or
session VWAP (or, from below, a reclaim of both EMAs/VWAP) while MACD 3/15/8
turns up; enter with “breakout or bailout” risk discipline. The dashboard now
defaults to the four surfaces that support that workflow: **🛰️ Live Ticks,
Momentum, Edge, and Momentum History**. The separate **⚡ Edge** tab now saves
the custom EMA pair per user/ticker and evaluates only those saved names on
closed 1-minute candles: feed-session VWAP + custom EMA bounce/reclaim +
standard EMA-MACD 3/15/8 (both line and histogram rising). The live state is
`warming → watching → armed → entry → bailout`; Armed is an intrabar proximity
heads-up (5m anti-repeat), while Entry/Bailout require a completed 1m candle.
An Entry holds its exact support/bailout reference until it is lost or the
operator resets after taking profit. Dashboard sound/browser notifications
and optional Telegram alerts are independently switchable per preset; every
transition persists to `edge_events` for later journal attribution.

**Edge architecture:** this does NOT re-enable the parked global technical
engines. `EdgeService` consumes the already-running Databento 1s stream,
aggregates/persists `edge_bars_1m` for saved tickers only, and warms each custom
EMA from a small 7-day Databento history (Yahoo 1m fallback). Presets live in
`user_edge_presets`; per-user state is served on authenticated `/api/edge`
polling rather than the shared global SSE. Session VWAP uses feed-visible HLC3
× volume from the 04:00 ET session; because EQUS.MINI can be thinner than the
consolidated TradingView tape, the UI remains a decision assistant and the TV
chart is the exact execution reference.

**Production status (checked 2026-08-21):** Edge shipped in `db2ad0d`
(`feat(edge): add per-ticker execution playbook`) with migration
`20260818190000_edge_playbook.sql`. `/health` is `ok`, `edge.running=true`,
`edge.last_error=null`, and the Databento stream is healthy (3.3M+ bars seen
since the current API start). The feature has processed live 1m bars,
historical backfill, and seven Edge transitions in production. There were zero
active saved presets at the time of this check—the previously exercised preset
had been removed—so an empty Edge table currently means “nothing configured,”
not a failed service.

**Deploy-order gotcha (still open):** the CI workflow currently recreates the
API/web containers *before* running `dbmate up`. On Edge's first rollout, the
new API started before `user_edge_presets` existed, logged
`[edge] startup failed: relation "user_edge_presets" does not exist`, and did
not retry after the migration landed. The migration applied successfully and
the API was manually restarted; that is the healthy state above. The Edge
tables now exist, so ordinary deploys are unaffected, but the general ordering
remains unsafe for a future service that requires a brand-new table at startup.
Next infrastructure change should run migrations before starting the new API,
or add an explicit post-migration API restart/retry path.

The previous experiments are **parked, not deleted**. `COMPONENTS_DISABLED`
defaults to `ignition,momo,setups,ema,swing,outcomes,continuation,edge` (`faders` is
an alias for `continuation`). This hides their tabs/lists and, critically,
stops their backend work: no Ignition/Swing Finviz calls or result writes; no
Outcome/Continuation jobs; no EMA/MACD bar replay, backfill, or bar-table
writes. When Swing/Outcomes/Continuation are all parked, `DailyBarsService`
does not start. Databento remains on in detector-only mode, so Live Ticks keeps
working. Set `COMPONENTS_DISABLED=` to restore everything, or remove selected
slugs to restore only those components. Feature state is visible in `/health`
and each cycle payload.

**Why the parking matters:** production profiling found the 4 GB droplet at
~2.8–3.1 GB Node RSS plus ~1.95 GB swap. Every ~10 minutes the Continuation
path read roughly 1.31M `daily_bars` rows for ~888 tickers before reducing them
in JavaScript, creating 39–65s poll gaps (occasionally ~101s). `daily_bars` had
grown to ~4.3M rows / 866 MB inside an ~8.2 GB database. A second repeated
client query was removed too: Quote Details history is no longer keyed by the
20-second `cycle_id`; it now caches per ticker for 60s.

**PRE-PIVOT FOCUS (2026-08-12, retained as experiment history): THREE instruments. (1) The ↗
price-reclaim layer — reclaim-ONLY on FIVE timeframes — remains the only
Telegram-alerting component, with A+/A/B attention tiers on the ↗ EMA tab.
(2) The ⤴ MACD MOMO tab (DEFAULT view since 08-06; built out over rounds
1-11, see XMOMO) — the operator's live second-leg strategy automated, now
in its full shape: FIVE ascending lanes (2M·5M·15M·1H·4H — 5m is 3/10/8,
the rest 3/15/8, settings sweep-picked), universe = EVERY Momentum-screen
name this session (∪ top-10/≥30% ignition-only movers), sticky per ET day,
red-on-day rows hidden, no qualification while the market is closed.
States render TV-parity off the live forming bar (multi-bucket synthesis
over MINI holes); events stay closed-bar. Badges: <0 (below-zero reset,
ranked first — 21/24 day-1 setups were <0) and ✓21 (operator's 21EMA
confirmation preference; the 5-session backtest graded above-EMA entries
WORSE — tooltips carry both sides, meta.above_ema21 is the live
referendum). Sort: state → <0 → newest event. Display+grading only
(tier='macd' with variant/below_zero/above_ema21 meta), no sounds/Telegram
until graded — see XMOMO below + docs/detection-layers.md ⤴ section. (3) A
new separate **🎯 SETUPS experimental tab** keeps raw MOMO as the control but
adds closed-bar structure confirmation: 5m curl → pullback/base → READY →
closed 2m pivot break with ≥1.5× volume and ≥$2k MINI notional → TRIGGERED.
It shows one row/ticker with pullback depth, base age, dry-up/re-expansion,
entry/trigger, structural stop/distance, 15m/5m/2m MACD context and feed age.
No sound/Telegram; transitions persist as `tier='momo_v2'`. New
`momo-setup.ts`, `MomoSetupsPanel.tsx`, and nullable OHLC on `bars_2m`
(migration `20260812150000`). Foundational XMOMO audit fixes shipped with it:
durable `qualify` events preserve sticky no-signal names across deploys;
event meta now separates `bar_ts`/`observed_at`; provisional crosses render
as `crossing`, not committed `crossed`; failed provisional setup geometry no
longer stays curling; daily episode counters reset; MACD reseeds alongside EMA
consolidated-history reseeds.** The 10/65 crossover channel is RETIRED
(2026-07-26, `cross_detect: false` everywhere; machinery kept + tested for a
data revisit). The chain otherwise runs in full (🤫 accum → ↗ reclaim →
👀 watch → 🛰️ confirm → screens; 📰 radar is DARK while Benzinga is parked;
every transition in `tier_events`; sidebar reseeds on boot).
- **↗ reclaim layer, current shape:** price crossing up BOTH EMA 10/65 on
  5m/15m/1h/4h/1d (bars_* warmup stores per tf; 1d on the 04:00-ET day
  grid, intrabar = its real-time path), **arming staged across in-band bars
  (XSTAGE)**, intrabar everywhere with NO stale
  wait (XVTAK), gap-decay on feed-scale bars only — never on consolidated
  replay (XFIEE) — with sparsest-first 2h Yahoo re-anchor whose range
  widens until the bar count clears warmup,
  pend-through-insufficient-evidence in all three shapes (thin sibling
  window / junk-dollar arming bar / decay-flip), basis-break guard ≥4.85×
  evaluated ONLY on the first tick after ≥6h of tick silence (XHYFM — a
  continuous walk to 5× is a runner, not a split; real splits still reset),
  weekend test prints dropped
  live + in backfills, corrupt-source guard (flip-flop + amplitude) → Yahoo
  fallback, split-adjusted seeds bounded to 1–3 day seams. Volume confirm:
  sibling ≥3×/5× + $10k notional ($500 junk floor), OR the
  exceptional-expansion escape (≥30× + ≥$1.5k + sib ≥2× dead-tape floor —
  the GSUN/CYCU/FCUV class; dashboard+grading only, no phone). Confirmed 5m
  rows carry **A+/A/B attention tiers** (A+ = HTF reclaim co-confirm ±2min
  + ≥20× → 32.3% reach +20% same-day; B ≈ the random-bar null → B-rest
  collapses in the UI, B-notable ≥30×/<$2 stays visible). Full spec:
  `docs/detection-layers.md` + `docs/ema-list-optimization-2026-08-01.md`.
- **Alert posture (operator's call):** Telegram = ↗✅ 5m reclaim confirms
  ONLY (`ema_reclaim` slug; HTF reclaims are dashboard+grading — promote by
  deleting one guard line in `pushCrossAlert` when graded). Everything else
  muted via `ALERTS_DISABLED` (the dormant `ema_cross` slug fires nothing).
  Dashboard sounds/title-flash are EMA-only. Alert silence ≠ detection
  failure.
- **Paid APIs parked (2026-07-25):** Benzinga + Anthropic tokens commented
  out in the droplet .env (key presence IS the toggle) — radar dark,
  classification rules-only, news = Finviz/Yahoo/SEC/halts. ~$150+/mo saved;
  re-enable = uncomment + `up -d api`.
- **Feed: Databento EQUS.MINI stays** (07-22 decision). The divergence
  stack is now heavily mitigated (gap-decay, re-anchors, guards) but the
  irreducible residual remains: consolidated-only tape (odd-lot curls,
  VTAK/EDBL premarket) is invisible until real lots print on MINI —
  SIP/PLUS (~$825/mo, via support) is the only true fix.

**THE PENDING TASK — the ~2026-08-12 checkpoint (ten clean sessions from
07-29).** Semantics are FROZEN since 08-01 (the 08-03 guard fix is a
state-destruction bug fix, additive-only, log-identifiable). The checkpoint
runs `apps/api/scripts/research/reclaim-grading.sql` — the cuts are all
committed, definitions frozen in code, baselines recorded in the headers:
q4 session-matched control (standard confirms measured at NO median edge on
2 sessions — does that null hold?), q5+q6 the exceptional-escape cohort
(does its 2.5×-up/1.75×-down asymmetry survive n≈50 + target-before-stop?),
q7 the A+/A/B tiers (does A+ hold ~32% reach-+20 and B-rest stay at the
null? what lands in the collapsed band — UPC-class AH winners?), q8 entry
mechanics (does the 81%-pullback / 2× win-rate result hold?). Decisions
queued for it: **Telegram promotion for HTF-aligned confirms (A+)** — FCUV
and HYFM (+650% each, phone silent) are the exhibits; escape → phone or
kill; the dead-tape conditional floor; per-tf keep/kill. Boundary log for
segmentation: 07-22 10/65 · 07-23 gap-decay+pends · 07-24 reclaim channel ·
07-25 weekend gate · 07-26 reclaim-only+15m/1d · 07-27 guards/no-stale-wait
· 07-28 staged arming + FIEE warmup holes · **07-29 11:16 ET escape

## Operating norms (how the operator likes work done)

- **Measure before acting.** We have `screener_outcomes` (forward 1/3/5-day
  returns per detection) — use it to validate/kill features with data, not
  intuition. Always gate `bars_forward >= horizon`; early/small samples are a
  direction check, not a verdict.
- **Ship via CI, without asking.** Commit to `main` → GitHub Actions builds +
  deploys (migrations first since 2026-10-01, then containers). The operator
  wants ship-and-verify, no confirmation prompts. Always: build web locally (`npm run build --workspace=apps/web`)
  AND api typecheck (`cd apps/api && npx tsc --noEmit`) before pushing — the CI
  matrix is fail-fast (a web tsc error silently cancels the api build).
- **Find the real CI run id** via `gh run list` — don't guess it.
- **Push needs VPN** (operator's region blocks GitHub port 22; the agent path
  may also be blocked — if `git push` gives "No route to host", the operator
  pushes from their own terminal with VPN on).
- **Prod = DigitalOcean droplet** `root@165.245.210.95`, `/root/projects/pnldash`,
  `docker-compose.prod.yml`. Admin login admin/123456. psql via
  `docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml exec -T postgres psql -U pnldash -d pnldash`.
- **Operator TZ is UTC+5** (Asia/Tashkent); the app is ET-anchored. The
  dashboard's "Appeared" and Alerts times are shown in UTC+5.
- **No hover tooltips** (operator's call, 2026-10-01) — explain things in
  visible UI text or not at all.
- **Fit, then validate out-of-sample, then port with parity.** The grade,
  the alert thresholds and the fade cap were all fitted on one month,
  checked on the next, and ported to TypeScript with row-for-row parity
  checks. Keep that bar for new scoring logic.

## Current strategy thesis (operator's, evolved 2026-06-02 → 06-12; refreshed 2026-10)

- **2026-10:** a Ross Cameron 5-criteria video shaped the current desk:
  catalyst, low float, already moving, 07:00–11:00 ET. On our data his
  $2–20 price band and day-RVol ≥5× did NOT discriminate inside our screen;
  change %, time of day, catalyst strength, float and live tape activity
  did. The grade encodes the measured version.

- **Catalyst quality is the #1 factor.** Momentum + catalyst, entered on the
  FIRST appearance, ride it, **exit when the larger pullback begins** (topping
  tails, MACD roll, heavy red volume). The exit is discretionary; the dashboard
  can only *assist*.
- **Fresh first-day names are where the edge is** — confirmed by outcomes
  (below). Multi-day "continuation" is a *negative* signal.
- Two scoring axes on news: **impact_score** (catalyst quality) and
  **hype_score** (pump/crowd potential, orthogonal — the STI +700% case).

## What shipped this session (newest first, all on prod unless noted)

XGRADE. **Momentum letter grade A+ … D (2026-10-01).** Operator watched a
Ross Cameron stock-selection video (RV ≥5×, ≥25M volume potential, up ≥10%,
$2–20, float <10M, breaking news; 07:00–11:00 ET) and asked for an A+/A/B
ranking next to each Momentum ticker, updated over time. Measured first
(operating norm): on 60 sessions of first-sight rows the checklist count
already graded monotonically (+20% later: 3% at 0 criteria → 18% at 4), but
only change %, time of day, news and float discriminated inside our screen;
$2–20 and day-RVol did not. Then FITTED per displayed cycle on 6.6M rows:
label = +10% within 30 min on screen; 9 bucketed features (change, float,
price, time of day, best non-bearish catalyst in 16h, age on screen, accel,
1m/5m volume burst/drying, VWAP side incl. "no volume since tracked");
points = smoothed log-odds lift fitted on August; letters cut at August
percentiles of the 6-cycle (2-min) rolling mean — A+ 3%, A 4%, A− 5%,
B+ 8%, B 10%, B− 10%, C 25%, D 35%. A first base-letter + live ± design was
dropped: A− (idle) graded 0.3% vs B+ 10.5% — an ordinal-reading trap; one
combined scale fixed it. Smoothing cut flicker 24 → 9 letter changes per
ticker-hour at equal accuracy. September (out-of-sample) table and the
first-touch race are in the top note + `momentum-grade.ts` header. Built:
`services/momentum-grade.ts` (pure buckets/points/cuts + per-ticker ring,
midnight reset); poller loads the 16h catalyst per screened ticker with one
indexed query per cycle (fails soft to "no catalyst"); `grade`/`grade_score`
on EnrichedRow + persisted (migration `20261001100000`); web Grade pill
column, default sort. Proof: `scripts/verify-momentum-grade.ts` pins
buckets/smoothing and replays the study's parity export — 201,981/201,981
letters match (ties needed a 1e-6 epsilon: decimal vs double sums). Re-fit
pipeline committed at `scripts/research/momentum-grade/` (export SQL +
DuckDB `study.py`, reproduces the shipped constants exactly). CI: migrations
now run BEFORE the new containers start. **Next:** after ~2 weeks, re-grade
the LIVE persisted grade (same label) — if it holds, consider re-fitting on
Aug–Oct; candidate add: a 1m MACD-negative exit tell (Ross's exit rule) as a
live feature for listed names only.

XVWAP. **↑ VWAP reclaim layer + Live Ticks alerts un-muted (2026-08-21).
RETIRED 2026-08-22 — see the top note; retained as history.**
Operator: "too often, when a ticker crosses the VWAP it rallies up" — list
them under Live Ticks, think about when to fade them. Built
`services/vwap-reclaim.ts` (pure tracker: session VWAP Σ(HLC3×vol)/Σvol
from 04:00 ET on the 1s bars, EVERY subscribed symbol; reclaim = 1m close
≥ VWAP×1.002 after ≥5 closed candles strictly below + ≥20 min tape + junk
floor; confirm = later close holds ≥ reclaim close or any close ≥ VWAP×1.01;
lost = close ≤ VWAP×0.997 with minutes-held + peak_pct telemetry — the
fade data; expire 10 min unconfirmed; ≤4 episodes/session; `anchor`
session|partial honesty for late subs / mid-session boots). Poller gate:
row only when the name is on a screen or in the ladder at reclaim time;
accepted episodes graded as `tier='vwap'` reclaim/confirm/lost/expire;
rows live-refresh price-vs-VWAP per 1s bar; display TTLs lost 5m /
reclaimed 15m / confirmed 60m; reseed rows on boot. Web: "↑ VWAP RECLAIMS"
sub-list in the Live Ticks sidebar (both lean + full layouts), soft tone on
reclaim, bright pair + notification on confirm. Telegram: slug
`vwap_reclaim` (confirm only, once/ticker/day) — MUTED in prod until
graded. Regression `scripts/verify-vwap-reclaim.ts` S1–S11. Known
limitation: a mid-session deploy resets every VWAP (partial anchors for
the rest of that session) — Databento 1m warmup is the upgrade path.
**Next:** after ~5 sessions, grade (see detection-layers ↑ section) →
decide phone promotion + the fade rule (lost-after-confirm peak/minutes
distribution).

XFEED402. **Databento feed DOWN 00:00–11:45 ET 2026-08-12 — unpaid
invoice (billing renewal); ⚠️ 08-12 is a PARTIAL-BLIND day for ALL
grading.** The midnight sidecar respawn hit HTTP 402
`account_delinquent_invoice`; the sidecar looped subscribe→fail all
premarket + 2h of regular session. ZERO tier_events all morning (reclaim
AND macd, every lane) — alert silence was outage, not absence; the
operator discovered it via giant ⏱ ages on the MOMO tab (states kept
rendering from live Finviz prices — the provisional fold masks a dead
feed) and missed real 2m crosses on BQ/SCKT. bars_5m looked deceptively
current (Yahoo-fallback backfills persist there); bars_2m told the truth
(nothing since Tue 19:58 ET). Recovery: operator paid; **the sidecar did
NOT self-heal after payment — `docker compose restart api` was required**
(free at that moment: no in-flight state existed). Ops rule for next
time: pay → restart api → confirm bars_seen climbs. OPEN: the
feed-watchdog Telegram alert (no bars ~10 in-session min → one push,
own `feed` slug) — proposed, operator hasn't confirmed; would have made
this a 04:10 ET buzz instead of an 11:30 discovery.

XMOMO. **⤴ MACD momentum-curl layer + top-gainers MOMO tab — the operator's
live strategy automated (2026-08-06).** The operator explained how they
actually trade around their day job: pick the session's top gainers, watch
the MACD 3/10/8 (all-SMA, histogram off) on 5m, enter when the line turns
up toward its signal after a pullback reset — "close to the crossover",
tight stop — because leaders make several big moves per session and they
always miss the first. Showed five 08-05 leaders (ZYBT/YXT/INLF/RITR/BJDX)
all carrying the same signature, with their INLF entry marked ~10:30 ET.
**Measured before wiring** (the operating norm): pulled the five names'
banked bars_5m from prod, built the pure detector, replayed — SETUP fired
at their exact marks: INLF 10:35 ET → +47%/60m, ZYBT 11:00 ET → +136%/30m,
YXT 13:40 ET → +63%/60m, RITR 10:55 ET at the base of a +29% run; BJDX's
premarket gap-open leg not catchable (the known gapper ceiling). Raw rate
~8 setups/name/session with real −10..−30% failures between → shipped as
an attention surface, NOT an alert: no Telegram, no sounds (operator chose
"tab only, decide after replay/grading"). NOT the twice-closed EMAMACD
book: universe conditioning (already a top gainer) is the point, and it
matches the entry-mechanics result (pullback 81%, pullback-hold 2× win
rate). **Built:** `services/macd-curl.ts` (SETUP = ≥2 rising line closes +
gap ≤65% of episode max + dead-chop floor 0.3% of price, re-arm on broken
curls; CROSS; closed-bars-only = TV parity with the operator's
"Wait for timeframe closes"); fed from the same known-runner 5m bar-close
callback the EMA layer banks + boot-seeded from the same split-adjusted
bars_5m replay; universe top-10 (≥10% floor) ∪ chg≥30, sticky per ET day,
gated in the poller so tier_events grades exactly the displayed
population; `tier='macd'` setup/cross events (fades display-only) with
reseed-on-boot; ⤴ MOMO tab as the new DEFAULT view (operator's call) — one
row per leader: curling (pulses fresh) / crossed / turning / cooling /
warming, gap%, <0 reset badge, setup/cross ago, news badge, full-day chg%.
Verify: `scripts/verify-macd-curl.ts` S1–S7 (incl. the honest edge: a
vertical V-recovery has no curl phase and legitimately goes straight to
CROSS); replay harness durable at `scripts/research/macd-curl-replay.ts`.
**Freeze untouched:** reclaim semantics/alerts unchanged; this is a new
parallel display layer. **Next:** grade setups after ~a week
(below_zero × chg band × time-of-day vs same-name non-setup bars) → decide
the gated Telegram subset (first-setup-of-day / <0-only are the candidate
dials).
**Same-day fix (the LPSN/WYHG lag, operator's first live check):** the tab
rendered state as of the last CLOSED bar, and a bucket only closes when the
NEXT trade lands on MINI — so thin premarket tapes lagged the operator's TV
panel by minutes (LPSN read "crossed" through a visible roll-over, WYHG
"turning" after TV's line had hooked above; XCH/MGRX/SURG matched, incl. a
live ✚ stamp on XCH). Display state now folds the LIVE screen price
(consolidated tape, no MINI blindness) into the rings as the forming bar —
provisional line/signal exactly as TV draws its panel. DISPLAY ONLY: events
and committed state stay closed-bar, grading unaffected. Off-screen sticky
names (no live price) fall back to closed-bar state with an honest ⏱Xm
staleness chip at ≥10 min.
**Round 2 (same evening, LPSN/GVH again — the MULTI-BAR hole):** one folded
bar can't represent a multi-bar fade the MINI feed never banked. Verified
on prod: LPSN's last banked 5m bar was TWO HOURS old (a 1-share $2.40
print) through its whole consolidated dust-print fade to $2.27; GVH had the
spike bars but none of the 3-bar dump to $0.88 — so the ring stayed full of
stale spike closes and both read green "crossed" against a TV panel well
below the signal. The fold now synthesizes EVERY missed in-session bucket
between the last real bar and now (flat carries at the live price, capped
at one full ring refresh — the gap-decay idea applied to SMA rings), which
converges the line to where a tape sitting at the live price puts it;
nights/weekends synthesize nothing (TV holds its panel across the close);
`rising`/'turning' can no longer be claimed across a synthesized hole
(fixes MGRX/AZI showing "turning" while TV's line fell). Off-screen names
fall back to the 5m EMA tracker's OPEN-bucket price before going
closed-bar; the ⏱Xm chip now keys on minutes-since-last-REAL-print
regardless of the fold. Verify suite → S8 (stale-hole convergence +
closed-session no-wash). WYHG meanwhile produced the first fully-live
staircase on the tab: ⤴ setup 6m → ✚ cross 55s at +106%, and CLRO's ✚30m
stamp sat at the base of its $7→$12 leg (+197%).
**Round 3 (operator's ask): below-zero resets rank first + real <0 badge.**
Sort is now state ladder (⤴ curling → ✚ crossed → turning → cooling →
warming) → **<0 first within the state** → day-chg desc. For CROSSED rows
the flag is stamped at the cross EVENT (origin) — the live line rises
through zero as the leg runs, which would strip the badge exactly when the
thesis works; other states read the live line. The <0 marker became a
bordered badge on every state (was tiny text, hidden on cooling).
Display-only; meta.below_zero already carries the grading cut. **Round 4
(operator's call, same evening): the third sort key is TIME, not
magnitude** — newest ⤴/✚ event first (no event → qualification time).
Chg-desc floated a stale −39% round-tripper (XCH, <0-origin) over the
+562% live mover; magnitude has its own column, and the row whose event
just fired is the acting one (the WLDS lesson, re-learned on this tab).
**Day-1 tally (first full session):** 24 setups / 53 crosses across ~20
qualified leaders — 21/24 setups below-zero (the announce-worthy curl IS
mostly the deep-reset class, consistent with the operator's read). WYHG
closed the loop: setup→cross staircase fired live at +106%, ran to +565%
same day.
**Round 5 (2026-08-07, operator's ask): the SECOND variant — 2m·3/15/8 —
as a side-by-side lane** (their other TV setup; layout chosen via
AskUserQuestion: two lanes like the EMA tab, each independently sorted).
MacdCurlConfig gained `variant` ('5m'|'2m', stamped on every event +
tier_events meta — the head-to-head grading cut); tickfeed buckets 2m
closes from the per-second stream itself (no tracker existed on that grid),
persists them to NEW `bars_2m` (migration 20260807090000, 3d retention,
2d boot replay, no split-adjust — a 23-bar horizon doesn't span seams);
poller rows/dedups key `${variant}|${ticker}`, per-lane display caps.
Same curl knobs (geometry rules are scale-free), same universe, same
freeze-safe posture. Suite → S9. ⚠️ First deploy: the 2m lane starts
EMPTY-ish ("warming" rows) — bars_2m only accumulates from this boot, so
each name warms ~46 min of active tape; full from the next session on.
⚠️ Watch item: yesterday's tooltip-commit CI rerun (31122015989) is STILL
'queued' in GitHub pre-queue limbo, uncancellable via API (409 "not yet
queued", force-cancel included). If it EVER materializes it would rebuild
adaa4fa images as :latest and deploy = revert prod; the marker-grep deploy
check catches it, any push re-fixes. Likely dropped internally.
**Round 6 (2026-08-08, Saturday): the THIRD lane — 15m·3/15/8 — settings
picked by MEASUREMENT.** Operator asked "what MACD settings for 15m?"; ran
an 8-config sweep (3/10/8, 3/15/8, 3/20/8, 3/10/16, 5/13/8, 5/20/9,
8/17/9, 12/26/9) over 18 recent leaders × 4 sessions of banked bars_15m
(the replay harness gained --interval/--fast/--slow/--signal flags —
durable). Result: **3/15/8 best short-horizon** (median +3.0%/1.5h, lowest
drawdown tier, ~20% fewer whipsaw crosses than 3/10/8); 8/17/9 the
fewer-but-bigger alternative (median +5.1%/3h, 23% reach +20%, later
entries); **the textbook 12/26/9 graded WORST on these tapes** (operator's
fast-MACD instinct confirmed). Operator picked 3/15/8 via AskUserQuestion
(8/17/9 and 5/13/8 offered with numbers). Build: `MACD_CURL_15M`; the
variant rides the 15m RECLAIM layer's bar stream (makeHtfLayer gained
`alsoOnBar`) and the same split-adjusted bars_15m boot replay — no new
table, no new aggregation, warm from boot. Lanes now ascending 2M·5M·15M.
tier_events meta.variant='15m'.
**Round 7 (research only, same day): the grid trade-off measured** —
operator asked "2m vs 5m vs 15m, all 3/15/8: easier / better / safer?".
New durable harness `scripts/research/macd-grid-compare.ts` (signals from
each grid's own bars, outcomes on the SHARED finest series at WALL-CLOCK
horizons — without both corrections the coarse grid fake-wins "safety").
Yahoo-consolidated, 26 leaders × 5 sessions (DB Friday cross-check
agrees): **frequency scales ~4× down the grid** (2m 7.4 → 5m 3.7 → 15m
1.7 setups/name-day), **capture is best on the finest grid** (up2h +3.4%
/ ≥20@2h 9% on 2m vs +2.6% / 4% on 15m — earlier entries), **per-setup
safety is best on the coarsest** (≤−5%@1h: 15m 16% vs 5m 24% vs 2m 27%),
and 15m curls resolve to a cross far less (68% vs ~87%). No single
winner — it's the classic MTF division of labor (2m = entry timing, 5m =
primary, 15m = context), which is what the three-lane tab already is.
Also measured: **5m 3/10/8 vs 3/15/8 = a wash** (identical within noise)
— the 5m lane keeps 3/10/8. Below-zero share stable 75-83% everywhere.
**Round 8 (2026-08-09): the 21EMA "confirmed/safe" proposal TESTED
INVERTED — shipped as a neutral marker instead (operator's choice via
AskUserQuestion).** Operator proposed "price above 21EMA at the turn =
confirmed/safe entry". Pre-study (grid-compare harness gained --trendema
N + the 2×2 vs below_zero; 26 leaders × 5 sessions): above-trend setups
graded WORSE on EVERY grid — lower capture AND more drawdown (2m: up30m
+0.9% vs +1.8%, dn −2.1% vs −1.3%; 15m: −10%@2h 18% vs 7%) — because
below-EMA setups are ~97% deep below-zero resets (the class that pays)
while above-EMA ones are the late re-extended curls; even the
"reclaimed-trend deep reset" 2×2 cell underperformed. Classic
trend-filter wisdom inverts on violent mean-reverters — same family as
12/26/9 grading worst. **Shipped:** `trend_ema: 21` on all three configs
(EMA computed per grid, SMA-seeded, folds through the provisional
carries), events + tier_events meta stamp `above_ema21` (the live
referendum), rows carry `above_trend`, UI shows a QUIET 21↑/21↓ chip
whose tooltip states the measured result — deliberately NO
"confirmed/safe" semantics, no sort/state change. Suite → S10.
**Round 8b (operator pushback, chart evidence — the NAMI 19:20 exhibit):**
MACD crosses under a DECLINING 21EMA on a bleeding chart are dead-cat
bounces; operator reaffirmed "safer with confirmation anyway". Tested the
slope hypothesis (fade vs repaired-base split of the below-EMA bucket,
±0.15%/5-bars) — **REFUTED: 94% of below-EMA setups fire while the EMA is
still falling and that cell carries the good aggregate stats**; after a
violent pullback the 21EMA keeps catching down through the real base, so
a lagging-line rule cannot separate INLF-class resets from NAMI-class
drifts. Resolution: the operator's discipline preference stands — chip
promoted to a green **✓21 badge** (above-EMA) vs muted 21↓, tooltips
carry BOTH sides honestly; still display-only, no gate/sort change;
`above_ema21` meta keeps grading the live referendum.
**Round 11 (2026-08-12, the RMCF case): the MOMO universe is now EVERY
Momentum-screen name this session** — RMCF ran +40%, pulled back, and
printed a textbook 2m curl-and-cross at 16:07 loc, but on a busy
premarket it never cracked the top-10 nor +30% at a cycle boundary, so
the layer never adopted it and the cross went unrecorded. Momentum
membership already carries the screen's change+relvol gates, so it IS
the quality filter; the top-10/≥30 union ranking stays only for
IGNITION-only movers (sub-$1 names below the momentum price floor).
Qualification reads the AH-gated momentumRows (hoisted above the MOMO
block so AH junk can't qualify); via gains 'momentum'; per-lane display
cap 30→40 for the wider set. Red-row hiding + closed-session gate keep
the lanes clean. Forward-looking only: names that left the screens
before the deploy don't qualify retroactively.
**Round 10 (2026-08-11, Monday premarket — operator report): the tab
opened with ~15 deep-red Friday leftovers.** Root cause: between 00:00
and 04:00 ET the screens still carry the FINISHED day's board with its
locked chg%, so the overnight cycles ranked Friday's leaders as
"today's" top-10 and pre-seeded Monday's sticky set (weekends
compounded it). Fixes: (1) qualification only runs while `session !==
'closed'` (the 04:00-ET-day philosophy — overnight + weekends qualify
nobody); (2) display hides rows RED on the full-day anchor — sticky set
untouched, a name reappears the moment it turns green, so deep pullbacks
that HOLD green (the entry zone) still show while gap-downs and
round-trippers don't. Reseed residual: contaminated names with 04:00+
events re-qualify on a deploy but stay hidden while red.
**Round 9 (2026-08-09): 1h + 4h lanes** — same 3/15/8 + 21EMA on the
swing grids, riding the 1h/4h reclaim layers' bar streams via alsoOnBar
+ their Databento-backfilled stores (bars_1h 35d / bars_4h 130d; warm
from boot, no new tables; 4h bars arrive pre-anchored to the ET session
grid). MOMO tab = FIVE ascending lanes (2M·5M·15M·1H·4H), mirroring the
EMA tab. The ⏱ thin-tape chip threshold now scales per grid (~2 buckets:
2m 6min … 4h 480min). ⚠️ Grading: 30m-2h horizons are sub-bar on these
lanes — judge 1h/4h setups on daily forward grading only. Also on the
record: a background commit task silently failed on a drifted working
directory (git add ran inside apps/api) and was reported shipped before
verification caught it — commits from background tasks now use absolute
repo paths; verify-by-bundle-marker caught it same turn.

XHYFM. **The basis-break guard wiped a +650% runner mid-run — guard now
tick-silence-gated (2026-08-03).** HYFM: dead tape at $0.55 for weeks, Monday
vertical to $4.08. The layer's best catch to date — 1h instant-confirm
$0.7501 (36×) intrabar ON the ignition bar, 15m+4h 99s later, TV's own EMA
pair at $0.678/0.684 — then at 07:34 the FFAI split guard read the CONTINUOUS
walk $0.551→$2.71 (4.92×) as a reverse split and deleted ALL FIVE layers'
state mid-run. Worse: the backfill re-seeded on the old basis and the next
tick re-broke it ($0.551→$3.37) — a loop that kept the symbol blind all day.
Third specimen (STKH 4.87× reset the 1d on 07-27's own ship day; PFSA/LGHL
forced the same-day 4.85× recalibration). Root cause: the guard compared
EVERY tick against the last COMMITTED close — which on Monday morning is
FRIDAY's (the open bucket never commits until the next bucket's tick), so a
runner walking up in prints minutes apart was tested against a 3-day-old
basis until one print crossed 4.85×. A basis break physically manifests on
the FIRST print after a gap; a continuous walk cannot be a split. Fix: the
guard now evaluates ONLY on the first tick after ≥6h of TICK silence, with
tick recency in a map OUTSIDE the resettable state (so a legit reset cannot
re-break on the post-reseed tick). FFAI protection intact (S32); S40 pins
the walk survival + no-re-break-loop. Suite → 40 scenarios.
⚠️ Shipped DURING the freeze as a state-destruction bug fix (operator's
call, AskUserQuestion 08-03): it prevents false wipes on the ≥4.85× runner
class — additive-only, affected names identifiable via the basis-break log
lines; grading can segment. Also on the record: HYFM produced ZERO phone
alerts (Telegram is 5m-confirm-only; the 5m likely pended on a thin sibling
and died in the wipe) — with FCUV that is two +650% names where HTF
alignment was the signal; the strongest exhibit yet for the checkpoint's
Telegram-promotion question. 5m never fired: not provable post-wipe (pends
are not persisted).

XTIER. **↗ 5m attention tiers A+/A/B — display-only (2026-08-01, codex
study + Claude cross-validation).** Operator: "too many 5m confirms, most
move <10-20%, a few (FCUV/DFNS/CYCU) are huge — can we optimize the list?"
Two independent analyses converged: codex found **HTF co-confirmation within
±2 min** is the primary axis (its no-HTF cell: 0.8% tail on 2 sessions);
Claude's price×ratio cells + audit found ratio≥30/price<$2 as secondary axes
and corrected codex's recall (10/11 was a 2-day artifact — the 07-29 session
held 5 more winners, NONE with HTF co-confirms, incl. NCRA +147% @133×).
3-session validation: **A+ (HTF+≥20×) 32.3% reach +20% same-day · A 10.0% ·
B 3.6% ≈ the random-bar null (2.5%)**. Shipped: poller stamps
`priority`/`co_tfs` on confirmed 5m reclaim rows (derived each cycle from
confirmed_at in the display map — late HTF confirms promote automatically,
no new state); UI shows A+/A chips with tf badges, collapses **B-rest**
(not notable: ratio<30 AND ≥$2) behind a "show all" toggle. Visible set
keeps 14/18 winners (78%) at ~60% list reduction. Ordering stays
newest-first (the WLDS lesson — tier-first would re-bury fresh reclaims);
DFNS on the record as never-capturable (confirm at +197% into its day;
day-chg% is the guard). Grading: query 7 in reclaim-grading.sql cuts the
exact tiers; checkpoint question = does B-rest hold at the null while A+
holds its rate, and what lands in the collapsed band. Addendum with the
recall correction appended to docs/ema-list-optimization-2026-08-01.md.
NO detection/alert/semantics change — the freeze holds.

XDASH2. **Four operator-reported dashboard fixes (2026-07-30 evening).**
All display/enrichment only — detection, confirm rules and alert eligibility
untouched, so the grading freeze and clean segment hold.
1. **The Alerts ON/OFF button never muted anything.** `AlertsToggle` wrote
   `localStorage['alerts.armed']` plus its own component state and NOTHING
   read either; `useScreenerAlerts` ran unconditionally from DashboardPage.
   Pressing OFF changed the label and colour while every confirmation kept
   beeping — there was no mute to fail, it did not exist. New
   `hooks/useAlertsArmed.ts` is the shared reference (custom event for
   same-tab, `storage` event for other tabs; device-local because arming also
   unlocks this browser's AudioContext). The mute is enforced INSIDE
   `beep()`/`notify()`, not at the ~12 call sites, so a future alert type
   cannot bypass it; the gate is mirrored during render because an effect
   would leak one beep on the muting cycle. ⚠️ Behaviour change: sound is now
   genuinely gated on armed, where before it played whether or not the user
   had ever armed. **Operator to verify the mute in-browser (owed).**
2. **Cross rows never showed news (the CYCU case).** `enrichCrossNews` set
   the cache to null as a stampede claim and never invalidated it, so "no news
   yet" became permanent for the ET day. CYCU's cross fired 08:20:14; Finviz
   did not carry its $54.6M contract PR until 08:23 — the row stayed newsless
   through a +274% day, three minutes short. That ordering is the layer's
   PREMISE (reclaim precedes headline), so one lookup at nomination is
   structurally too early. Now retries 3x/10min while the row is <45 min old,
   driven from the payload build because a ticker whose only cross preceded
   its headline has no later event to trigger one. Was 131 of 145 rows
   newsless. **Real test is tomorrow's open.**
3. **Day change% on every reclaim row.** The tick feed already holds a prior
   close for every subscribed symbol, so this was a lookup, not a fetch.
   Coverage went 16/126 → 109/109 after falling back to the tracker's
   `lastClose` (bucketClose is 0 until a symbol ticks, and the boot seed
   replays closed bars only, so after every deploy the panel went blank for
   anything not currently trading). Confirmed rows now show a LIVE price too —
   a frozen confirm price beside a live change% was incoherent.
4. **⚠️ The EMA change% anchor differs from the screener's, deliberately.**
   `fetchScreener`'s v=152 overlay replaces Momentum/Ignition `change_pct`
   with Finviz's AFTER-HOURS change (since the 4pm close) in the afterhours
   session ONLY. EMA rows stay FULL-DAY in every session — extension is what
   the panel judges. Measured divergence 2026-07-30 AH: CYCU +888% vs +63%,
   GCTK +240% vs +25%, MGRX -10% vs +67%, with prices agreeing (only the
   anchor differs). Operator's call to label rather than converge: tooltip
   states the anchor and warns in AH; a superscript "d" marks the divergent
   session. Precedent: ScreenerPanel already retitles its own column "AH Chg %".

XGRADE. **First production review of the reclaim layer — and the evidence
plumbing it exposed (2026-07-30, codex investigation + review).** Full doc:
`docs/reclaim-strategy-investigation-2026-07-30.md`; reproducible cuts:
`apps/api/scripts/research/reclaim-grading.sql`.
**The headline result, after correcting the method twice.** The doc first
reported post-confirm follow-through in ABSOLUTE terms (median 30m MFE
+0.38%), which reads as failure; a null baseline was missing. Adding a
random-bar control put the tail lift at 2.9× — but that control spanned
04:00-19:00 ET, comparing regular-hours confirms against quiet premarket/AH
bars. **Session-matched and bootstrapped (4 draws, stable ±0.1pp), regular
hours only, 60m:** confirms n=80 vs control n≈1,900 — median MFE +0.62% vs
+0.63% (**no median edge**), mean +1.45% vs +1.17% (1.2×, not 2.9×), reached
+5% 8.8% vs 4.3% (**~2.0×**), fell <=-3% **35.0% vs 15%** (**~2.3× worse**).
So the 5m confirm is a **volatility selector whose raw skew on closes runs
slightly AGAINST you**, not the favourable asymmetry an unmatched control
suggested. ⚠️ Evidence quality is lopsided: the downside amplification is
solid (28 of 80 vs ~12 expected, z~5) while the upside rests on 7 events
(z~2, one session) — **the adverse selection is established; the tail benefit
that would justify it is not.** Whether the layer is tradeable now hinges
entirely on ORDER OF ARRIVAL (can a tight stop execute before the favourable
excursion?), which close-only bars cannot answer.
**Also measured:** extension already paid between reclaim and confirm —
median +0.74%, p90 +5.41%, i.e. the confirmation wait consumes roughly half
the median move. And higher absolute notional did NOT rank follow-through, so
the $10k floor is not a quality filter (which weakens the case against the
escape rather than for raising the floor).
**Shipped (instrumentation only — semantics FROZEN):** (1) `bars_5m` gains
nullable **open/high/low** (migration `20260730100000`) — the sidecar already
emitted o/h/l/c/v and onBar already parsed them; they were dropped one line
later. Accumulated in tickfeed and attached in the bar-close callback, so
`ema-cross.ts` is untouched (threading h/l through addBar would change a
signature the whole verify suite depends on); EMA math still reads
close/volume only. (2) **Retention 6d -> 45d** — at 50 MB per 6 days the old
window pruned the early sessions of a ten-session review before they could be
graded; raw bars kept deliberately instead of a pre-computed outcome table so
later questions can use metrics nobody has thought of yet.
**NOT changed, deliberately:** EMA 10/65, staged arming, observation windows,
the $10k floor, `exceptional_vol_x`, volume ratios, Telegram eligibility.
**Next checkpoint:** ~3 sessions for a direction check, ~10 for thresholds.
Owed: stable `observation_id` in meta (removes fuzzy temporal joins — deferred
to its own change rather than stacked on this one), and the target-before-stop
grid (query 6 in the grading script, live from 07-30 bars onward).
⚠️ **Deploy discipline:** no routine API deploys 09:30-16:00 ET — a restart
drops in-flight 5m observations (one of mine killed GSUN's 5.7 min into its
window). This change went out 06:35 ET premarket at a measured cost of 7
in-flight 5m rows (~0.7 expected confirms) to buy a full session of OHLC.

XFLOOR. **The GSUN escape + the 'no in-flight predictor' result
(2026-07-29).** Two findings from the operator working the new EMA tab live.
(1) **GSUN**: 5m reclaim nominated 09:52 at $0.191 on a **55.5×** volume
bar — the strongest evidence the layer can see — but at $0.19/share that is
$1,909, under the flat $10k confirm floor, so no confirm and no alert while
it ran to $0.29 (+52%). The floor is price-blind and a sub-$1 name cannot
clear it on a 5m bar however violent the burst. Measured before changing
anything: confirms sit at p10 $10,313 / median $14,461 (the floor IS the
gate) but the median NOMINATION bar is $1,161 (the floor earns its keep) —
dropping it to $2,500 admits ~150/day vs ~86/day today. Shipped instead as a
bounded escape: **ratio ≥30× AND ≥$1,500 AND sib_median ≥2× the dead-tape
floor** (~7/day). The verify suite caught the flaw in a ratio-only version:
a ratio is most inflated where the baseline is DUST (S26/S29's 10-share
median makes any bar 300×), so it would have confirmed exactly the dead-tape
trickles the operator chose to keep nominate-only (PBM). ⚠️ Dashboard +
grading only, no Telegram (X4H precedent) — they are the confirms with
`meta.notional < 10000`. Suite → 39 scenarios.
(2) **No in-flight predictor exists.** A 'holding' tier shipped that morning
lit 32 of 40 rows on the 5m lane; measuring properly showed why nothing
could work: confirmed vs expired observations differ by only 1.4× on price
(median +0.65% vs +0.44%), volume ratio is circular, and the confirm hazard
is FLAT in age (~2%/bucket, 89.5% never confirm). Retiered as descriptive
`◆ moving` (live price ≥3% off the reclaim, ~6% of rows). **Do not build
another "about to confirm" tier** — it is the founding result restated.
Also this session: the ↗ EMA tab (five lanes, default view, caps
40/30/30/25/20), rows refreshed live with % since reclaim, `/latest` DB
fallback so a reload paints in ~4s instead of ~39s, and the confirmed-first
sort replaced (it was starving fresh reclaims out of view entirely — 11
confirmed rows alive against a cap of 10 meant observing rows got ZERO
slots).
⚠️ **A mid-session deploy costs in-flight 5m observations** — GSUN's died
5.7 min into its window when the API restarted. Reseeded 5m observing rows
are dropped by design; prefer deploying outside 09:30-16:00 ET.

XFIEE. **The FIEE miss — THREE stacked holes, all in the 5m layer's ability
to see a trickle tape (2026-07-28, operator-caught).** FIEE ran +156%
(~$2.75 → $10.33, 10:35–11:30 ET); only the 1d (11:24, $7.04) and 4h
(12:00, $8.37) layers fired. Operator asked why the 5m didn't, pointing at
a visible reclaim on their chart. `ema-debug` gave the first answer:
**`ema_slow: null` — the 5m and 15m trackers had never warmed** (30 and 39
bars vs 65 needed), so those layers were structurally incapable of firing,
which from the outside is indistinguishable from the documented
already-above-the-stack blind spot. Three independent causes, each fixed:
(1) **The below-warmup backfill threw its own data away.** It fetches
history, then seeds only `if (canSeed)` — false the moment a symbol has
produced one live bar. A trickle name streams a few bars a day, so it was
never seedable, and the sparse re-seed (which HAS the
`reseedFromHistory` fallback) explicitly required past-warmup names.
FIEE sat in the gap forever. Now the below-warmup path reseeds too, and
the sparse sweep's past-warmup floor is gone.
(2) **Warmup is a BAR COUNT; the fetch window was a CALENDAR window.**
`fetchYahoo5m` asked for `range=5d`, which assumes ~192 buckets/day of
prints — FIEE's entire consolidated week was 86 bars. No number of retries
could ever reach 65. The range now escalates 5d → 1mo → 60d until the count
clears 2× warmup (FIEE: 86 → 178 → 688). Dense names never escalate.
(3) **Gap-decay was being applied to CONSOLIDATED replay history — and it
un-armed the channel.** Decay exists to synthesise bars our MINI subset
missed but the consolidated tape carried (CPHI). A consolidated series has
none to synthesise: its holes are the MARKET's, and TV decays nothing
between prints either. Compounding hundreds of phantom steps on a thin
name dragged FIEE's EMA65 to **2.77 vs TV's 3.67** — below the price, so
the channel was never armed. Decay is now skipped when replaying a
consolidated series (feed-scale history still decays; CPHI intact, pinned
by S38). Measured on FIEE's real tape: seeded EMA10 2.88 / EMA65 3.45 vs
the operator's TV 3.01 / 3.67, **armed=true** — vs `null` before.
Also shipped alongside: **staged arming** (see XSTAGE) and **sparse-sweep
ordering by 24h density** instead of pure staleness — stalest-first
assumed a fresh newest bar means the live tape is self-correcting, but a
trickle name prints every ~20 min: always "fresh", never dense, and FIEE
sat behind ~800 staler names on the day of its burst. Sorting on last-24h
bar count keeps the OMH lesson for free (a silent name has n24 ≈ 0 and
still sorts first). Suite → 38 scenarios / 128 checks. New durable tool:
`scripts/research/reclaim-staged-arming-replay.ts TICKER` replays any
name's real consolidated tape through old vs new semantics.
⚠️ **The clean grading segment moves to 2026-07-29.**

XSTAGE. **Staged reclaim arming — the staircase curl (2026-07-28).** The
arming was a single-bar flag: prev close ≤ BOTH EMAs, else disarmed. So the
channel only fired when both crossings landed on ONE bar — but TV evaluates
the operator's two "Crossing Up" alerts INDEPENDENTLY, and real curls stage
them. FIEE cleared EMA10 at 10:35 ET and EMA65 twenty minutes later; every
in-band bar between them killed the arming. The arming now survives up to
`staged_arm_bars` closed bars spent inside the band (5m/15m 6, 1h 4, 4h/1d
3), and is cleared by a close above both (the fire) or by running out of
staging. `staged_bars` rides in every reclaim event and in tier_events meta:
**0 = a fire the old semantics would also have made, >0 = a staircase only
this catches** — grade the two populations separately before promoting
anything to Telegram, since this widens nomination (the volume-confirm
funnel is untouched, so the alert surface stays gated). S28 was rewritten
(it asserted the old exclusion), S36/S37 pin the new contract. Honest
scope note: on FIEE itself the warmup/decay fixes were the load-bearing
ones — with a warm tracker the layer fires at 09:45 either way; staged
arming adds a second, later nomination. Its justification is the general
shape, not this one case, which is exactly why it ships instrumented.

XEDBL. **Junk prints can no longer disarm the reclaim + amplitude guard
(2026-07-27 afternoon, both operator-caught).** (1) EDBL burst +140% at
08:16; only the 4h + tick tiers fired. The operator's 2m zoom showed
prior pops over both EMAs at 06:42/07:00 — those were 2-15 SHARE prints
($7-50): the junk floor rightly refused to nominate, but the bars still
closed above the stack and flipped prevBelowBoth — dust consumed the
arming, so the real burst found 5m/15m/1h disarmed. Now a coherent
junk-dollar bar closing above both EMAs PENDS (pendingR, anchored there)
and converts intrabar when dollars arrive; outlier junk still discards
(S35). (2) EDBL's 4h slow EMA read $4.3M — a single off-scale poison
print in a fetched series slips past the flip-flop corrupt test; the
guard gained an amplitude criterion (any bar ≥20× off the series median
→ corrupt → Yahoo fallback) and 751 zero-volume spike bars were purged
from bars_4h across ~10 tickers. Suite → 35 scenarios / 115 checks.

XVTAK. **Reclaim intrabar drops the stale-EMA guard (2026-07-27,
operator's call — the VTAK cost).** VTAK's 2482× burst confirmed at
08:05:09 — the first bar CLOSE — because the stale guard suppressed
intrabar detection after hours of MINI silence, costing ~4 min on top of
the tape-visibility gap (MINI saw NOTHING of the 07:40-08:00 consolidated
curl; first banked bar WAS the burst bucket). The guard predates
gap-decay, which keeps EMAs honest through silence — a resume print
clearing the decayed stack IS the quiet-curl signal. Removed for the
reclaim intrabar path only (cross path unchanged); PBM-class dead-tape
⚠️ rows fire minutes earlier intrabar, same floors/containment. S34.
⚠️ Reclaim semantics changed again → its clean segment starts 07-28.
Residual VTAK-class lag (~5 min of consolidated-only curl) is the feed
boundary — SIP/PLUS remains the only true fix.

XSPLIT. **The FFAI split phantom — basis-break guard + weekend-clean
backfills (2026-07-27, Monday premarket).** The 1d layer's FIRST live fire
was a phantom: FFAI reverse-split (~1:90) effective Monday; our daily EMAs
sat on the old basis ($0.13/$0.28 vs Friday's $0.074 close) and the first
post-split print at $6.95 "reclaimed" both by 25×. Two root causes, both
fixed: (1) **basis breaks** — `EmaCrossTracker.addBar` now detects
split-like overnight jumps (mirrors adjustSplitHistory: ≥4.85×
unconditional, 1.94–4.85× near-whole, symmetric for forward splits,
same-session moves exempt) and RESETS the symbol's state — warmup blocks
events until the backfill reseeds on the new basis; better an hour blind
than a phantom (S32). (2) **Saturday test prints leaked via the HISTORICAL
path** — the live-sidecar weekend gate can't help a backfill; Sat pre-04:00
ET test prints landed inside Friday's still-open DAILY bucket (FFAI's
Friday bar banked as $6.50) — all three historical fetchers now drop
ET-weekend source rows. Cleanup: bars_1d TRUNCATED for a clean rebuild
(the Friday-bucket contamination class isn't row-filterable), FFAI's
phantom event deleted (SDOT's too — overzealous: its banked basis was
already post-split, that reclaim was likely real). 1d layer re-warms over
~1h Monday morning; suite → 32 scenarios / 108 checks.

XRCL2. **Crossover retired; reclaim-only on FIVE timeframes (2026-07-26,
operator's call).** After three days watching both channels live, the
operator kept the ↗ price-reclaim and killed the 10/65 crossover as a
nomination source — `cross_detect: false` on every config (the machinery
stays intact + tested via CROSS_ONLY/BOTH_ON in the verify suite; a data
revisit is one flag; historical tier_events stay interpretable —
meta.signal absent = cross). ⚠️ The planned cross-vs-reclaim A/B is MOOT
— the grading pass becomes reclaim precision per timeframe. Also added
**15m** and **1d** reclaim layers (operator's ask): htfLayers now
15m/1h/4h/1d + the bespoke 5m — new `bars_15m` (12d retention, Databento
ohlcv-1m, Yahoo 15m×60d fallback) and `bars_1d` (260d retention,
ohlcv-1h re-bucketed to the 04:00-ET day grid via `etDailyOffsetSec`,
Yahoo 1d×1y fallback; deepDays 160 is the convergence skip — minBars 200
would mean 10 months). A 1d bucket only closes on the next day's first
print, so intrabar is the real-time path (the point). Telegram: reclaim
confirms still 5m-only. Suite → 31 scenarios / 105 checks (S30
prod-configs-are-reclaim-only, S31 new-grid tf stamping; S12/S15/S27
pinned to cross-enabled variants). ⚠️ First boot pays the 1d Databento
pass (~1,500 syms × 240d ohlcv-1h, metered — larger than the 4h pass,
one-time); 15m/1d layers warm from backfill — grade them from
convergence, not from deploy time.

XRECL. **↗ Price-reclaim channel — the operator's TV "price Crossing Up
EMA(10) AND EMA(65)" alert pair, as a PARALLEL nomination channel
(2026-07-24).** Operator asked to detect the AND-ed price-crossing
conditions "instead of" the crossover; measured first (4d banked bars,
$500 floor): reclaims fire ~1.6× the crossover's raw rate and only 11%
of reclaim bars coincide with a crossover bar — a different event set
(pre-crossover precursor / post-crossover pullback-reclaim). Recommended
parallel over replacement (the crossover's clean segment started 07-24
same day); operator agreed. Built: reclaim detection in the tracker
(prev close ≤ both EMAs → price > both; intrabar + closed-bar; SEPARATE
watchR/confirmedTodayR/lockedUntilR so the funnels never gate each other
— cross semantics untouched, its segment holds), same volume-confirm
rules/floors/stale-guard, thin-sibling skip (reclaims re-arm naturally,
no pend), events tagged `signal:'reclaim'` via a drain queue (cross keeps
addBar's return). Poller: rows/dedups key `${tf}|R|${ticker}` (cross keys
unchanged → reseed continuity), tier_events meta.signal (the A/B cut),
new `ema_reclaim` Telegram slug (independent of ema_cross; headline
"↗✅ PRICE RECLAIMED EMA 10+65"), reseed carries signal. Web: blue ↗ tag
+ "reclaim Xm ago" rows; alert/title-flash keys include signal.
Same-day follow-up: HTF enabled too (`reclaim_detect` true on 1h/4h —
measured raw rates 1h ~200-270/day, 4h ~60-110/day, both ~1.7-1.8× their
crossover) with reclaim Telegram gated to **5m only** (X4H precedent;
full-tf pushes would add ~50-85/day on the 1h 20-27 / 4h 8-23
cross-confirm baseline — dashboard rows + tier_events grade all tfs).
Suite → 29 scenarios / 101 checks
(S27 funnel+independence, S28 arming rules, S29 pending reclaim); legacy
scenarios pinned to CROSS_ONLY config so the cross channel stays tested in
isolation. **Same-day fix (the AMIX burst):** v1 SKIPPED thin-sibling
reclaims ("re-arms on the next dip-below-both") — but a vertical ignition
never dips back: AMIX's burst met the reclaim condition on a 42-share
sibling window; the cross pended through it (CPHI mechanism) and confirmed
92×, the reclaim stayed silent and missed the move (1h reclaim caught it
at 470×). Reclaims now PEND on thin windows + convert on dollars
(`pendingR`, dies at any close back inside the stack) — mechanism parity
so the A/B compares signals, not plumbing. ⚠️ reclaim semantics changed
→ the reclaim channel's clean segment starts 2026-07-25 (cross untouched,
its segment stays 07-24).
**Grading:** both channels grade from tier='cross' segmented on
meta.signal (absent = cross); compare nominate→confirm + forward outcomes
after ~a week, then keep/kill/expand-to-HTF.

XGAPD. **The CPHI 15-minute lag → gap-decay: TV-parity EMA horizons on
sparse tapes (2026-07-23).** Operator: "why 18:50, not 18:35?" — their TV
10/65 alert fired ~09:35 ET, ours 09:50:53 at $2.04 (the top of the move).
Root cause was NOT a guard or a missing print: our closes matched TV's
bar-for-bar, but 65 bars of MINI tape reach back DAYS (CPHI banks ~55
bars/day; the **median tracked name banks 33/day, 81% < 55** — CPHI is the
NORM, not an edge case), so our EMA65 still remembered Monday's $2.20 tape
($1.88) while TV's dense consolidated series had decayed to $1.74. Fix
shipped in three mechanisms (all timeframes, kill switch `gap_decay`):
(1) **Gap-decay** — every empty in-session bucket folds the last close into
the EMAs exactly as if a flat carry bar printed; computed lazily in closed
form on the next tick (no timers, no synthetic bars in state/warmup/
siblings/persistence; seed replay applies the same rule → live and reseeded
state stay bit-identical; nights/weekends decay nothing, like TV). A
fast-over-slow flip DURING a gap parks a PENDING quiet-curl cross at the
carry price — the ZBAO mechanism reused. (2) **Thin-sibling pend + intrabar
conversion** — the decayed CPHI cross landed where the sibling ring (days of
junk prints, median ~40 sh) sat under the 50-sh dead-tape floor, which used
to consume the cross SILENTLY; a real-dollar cross over a dead window now
pends, and ALL pendings convert INTRABAR the second bucket dollars
accumulate (monotone-volume soundness; conversion gated on the provisional
diff so a crashing tick can't convert a dying cross). (3) **Warm-but-sparse
consolidated re-seed** — the Yahoo fallback only rescued below-warmup names
(CPHI's 329 banked bars = "warm"); now names under 120 banked LAST-24H bars
(`SPARSE_5M_MIN_BARS_24H`) get their EMA state rebuilt from Yahoo's
consolidated tape via `reseedFromHistory` (refuses mid-observation, keeps
day flags + the feed-scale sibling ring; most-recent-active first, 400/scan
cap, deferrals logged), and the HTF backfill gained the same warm re-seed
(CPHI 1h: EMA65 2.73 vs fast 1.92 — a weeks-deep horizon).
**Same-day follow-up (the RELL/LFMD report, operator's TV check):** the
first cut re-seeded once/ET-day and persisted the Yahoo bars — wrong twice:
path divergence re-accumulates within HOURS on MINI-quiet names (RELL
re-fired a morning TV cross as "fresh" at 12:50; LFMD crossed while TV's
fast sat 3% below its slow — its confirm did catch a real +5% pop, for the
record), and persisted Yahoo bars made swept names read "dense", excluding
them from later sweeps for days. Now: **2h per-symbol retry** (HTF's
pattern), criterion = last-24h banked density, **no persist** from the
sparse path; **ordering flipped to stalest-first 07-24 evening (the OMH
lesson)** — MINI was blind through OMH's entire premarket (no prints
18:30 ET → 09:20 ET) while consolidated dipped below the stack and
re-armed both TV signals; OMH sat behind 912 fresher names in the sweep
queue and 4 deploys kept resetting the in-memory retry map, so its slot
never came before the +100% burst (the 4h reclaim + tick ladder caught
it). Stalest banked tape = blindest = first; deploy resets become
harmless. Known transient documented: a deploy boot re-derives all EMA
state → a burst of nominations in the first minutes (8 of 10 sidebar rows
fired ≤8 min after the 07-23 16:44 boot) — one-time per deploy, volume
stage disposes. First sweep on prod: 374/400 re-seeded + 834 deferred;
1h warm-reseed 108/109, 4h 360/361. **Verified:**
replay of CPHI's real banked bars → pend 09:30–35, nominate 09:35 @$1.73,
confirm 09:40 intrabar (vs live actual 09:50:53/$2.04) — the TV alert
matched; suite now 26 scenarios (S22 decay≡flat-fill parity, S23 in-gap
flip→pending→dollars, S24 closed-session no-decay, S25 warm re-seed
contract, S26 dead-sibling pend/convert; S1–S21 unchanged — the default sim
epoch is a Sunday, so pre-decay scenarios keep exact semantics). ⚠️ ratio
meta on thin-sibling conversions is inflated (vs a junk median — CPHI reads
91×/890×); `sib_median` rides in meta and the thin-tape ⚠️ still marks the
rows — segment in grading. ⚠️ **Cross semantics changed again → the clean
10/65 segment starts 2026-07-24.** Deferred: Databento EQUS.PLUS historical
polling (consolidated intraday top-ups, metered cents) if grading still
shows residual divergence.

XTAPE. **The thin-tape day (2026-07-22 afternoon): the operator stress-tested
the EMA layer against TV all day; every miss traced to ONE root — EQUS.MINI
is a subset tape — and each manifestation got its mechanism.** The chain:
(1) **LBTYK phantom** — 1-share $11 odd-lot print +10% off market nominated;
SIP excludes odd lots so TV never saw it → `nominate_min_notional` junk
floor, calibrated $500 from meta (all measured phantoms <$400; the $500-2k
band held real thin crosses — BANL/ALP). (2) **SKYQ stale-cross-as-fresh** —
MINI silent 2.5h while consolidated traded; frozen EMAs "crossed" on the
resume tick → `stale_gap_bars` guard (intrabar suppressed after >3 intervals
in-session silence; session-open exempt). (3) **thin-tape ⚠️** on rows with
sibling notional <$5k at cross ("verify on chart"). (4) **in-ladder 5m
display skip REMOVED** (LABT: Telegram fired, row hidden in a section the
operator hides — alert and row must match). (5) **TV-log audit**: 11 TV 1h
alerts vs our 1 — all misses = sparse/stale MINI 1h series → HTF backfill
gains Yahoo consolidated fallback + staleness targeting (newest bar >12h) +
hourly rescan w/ 2h per-symbol retry; verified live (TMDE 98 stale bars →
948 fresh). (6) **FAC anatomy** — 11-min lag fully explained by a 25-min
MINI print gap; led to the feed decision: **operator chose to STAY on
EQUS.MINI** (SIP/PLUS upgrade path documented in tick_feed_scoping memory).
(6b) **LICN 5m warmup fix** (same day, morning): 16 MINI bars in 3d while
Yahoo had 167 — the 5m Yahoo fallback now triggers on SPARSE (not just
empty) MINI series; bars_5m seed window 48h→5d, retention 3d→6d,
direct-seed slice 120→200 bars. (6c) freshly confirmed rows pulse green
(tf-scaled: 5m 5min / 1h 15min / 4h 30min).
(7) **ZBAO pending-cross mechanism** — a price-coherent cross on a junk bar
(the quiet curl, the operator's core thesis) is PENDED, not consumed;
converts to nomination/confirm when dollars arrive while fast>slow, anchored
at the ORIGINAL cross (`cross_ts_sec`, meta `pending_min`); outlier junk
(LBTYK class, `junk_outlier_pct` 5%) still discarded. (8) **Calculation
audit**: S14 golden EMA (1e-9), S19 seed/live bit-identity, backfill-1h ==
live-5m closes join (8/8 exact), `/ema-debug` endpoint; suite = 21
scenarios. Alert surface (phone+sounds+title) is EMA-only per XALRT + web
kill-switch maps in useScreenerAlerts/useTabTitleFlash (observe=soft E5,
confirm=B5→F#6 pair). ⚠️ Grading: cross semantics changed repeatedly TODAY
(floors 11:05, floor $500 + guards ~13:50-15:20, pending-cross ~16:30 UTC) —
the clean 10/65 segment effectively starts 2026-07-23.

XALRT. **📈 cross-confirm Telegram + everything else muted (2026-07-22,
operator's call).** New `ema_cross` alert component: 📈✅ push on every
volume-confirmed cross (any timeframe; once per ticker+tf/ET-day, dedup
reseeded from tier_events on boot so deploys don't re-ping; message carries
tf, expansion multiple, cross price + extension, intrabar flag, and the
day's catalyst when the news enrichment has landed). Simultaneously the
droplet's `.env` sets `ALERTS_DISABLED` to ALL other components (momentum,
ignition, new_ignition, fresh_burst, accum, tick_watch, tick_catch, radar,
dual_signal, swing) — detection/grading/dashboard unaffected, re-enable by
editing the env + `up -d api`. The phone now speaks only when a cross
confirms. ⚠️ The muted components' alert *quality* can no longer be judged
from Telegram history — tier_events remains the only grading source.

XNEWS. **📈 cross rows get news support (2026-07-22).** Cross tickers are
mostly off-screen, so the per-cycle news fan-out never covered them; rows
now enrich async — DB-first (Benzinga market-wide sweep/radar articles),
`fetchAndStoreTickerNews` top-up as fallback, shared URL classification
cache, cached per ticker/news-day, applied across all of a ticker's
timeframe rows. UI: 🔥 CatalystBadge on the row → news modal. Same day:
EMAs 6/50→10/65 all layers + 5m cooldown 60→30min (see grading caveat in
the pending task). Grading cut now available: crosses with vs without
same-day catalyst (SQL join tier_events↔news_articles).

ALRT. **Per-component Telegram kill switches + 📰 radar toggle (2026-07-21,
follow-up to EMAX).** Operator asked whether hidden components should stop
being computed server-side; answer on the record: NO — layers feed each
other (radar arms the detector, accum promotes through 👀, EMA grading
reads ladder state) and an uncomputed layer is an ungraded layer. The
architecture is: compute always → grade always → alert selectively →
display selectively. Shipped the two missing dials: (a) `ALERTS_DISABLED`
env var (comma-separated slugs: momentum, ignition, new_ignition,
fresh_burst, accum, tick_watch, tick_catch, radar, dual_signal, swing) —
checked at all 12 sendTelegram sites in the poller; dedup sets still mark
suppressed alerts so re-enabling mid-day doesn't replay the backlog;
muted set logged on first alert. (b) NEWS RADAR joined the hideable
sidebar sections (📰 toggle, `hide_news_radar`). `/alerts off` remains the
global mute; `TICKFEED_ENABLED` remains the whole-feed circuit breaker.

EMAX. **📈 EMA-cross layer promoted to first-class citizen (2026-07-21, the
operator's favorite component).** Four asks, all shipped: (1) **intervals
are configurable** — tracker refactored around an `htfLayers` list in
tickfeed (`makeHtfLayer(cfg, table, {spanDays, retentionDays, deepDays,
offset})`); **1h added** (`EMA_CROSS_1H`, migration `20260721130000_bars_1h`,
30d Databento backfill / 35d retention, 2-bar cooldown); adding/removing an
interval = one entry + one migration. (2) **UI groups crosses per
timeframe** — 📈 EMA 5M / 1H / 4H sections, payload capped per tf (10/8/8),
HTF display windows 3h/6h. (3) **LIVE TICKS + ignition NEW/TOP list are
hideable** — new header toggles (🛰️/⚡, strikethrough when off), persisted
per-user in `user_panel_layout` (`hide_live_ticks`/`hide_ignition_list`);
DISPLAY-ONLY: poller/alerts/tier_events untouched, re-enable is instant;
hiding the ignition list uncaps the EMA sections' heights. (4)
**calculation review** — golden-reference test (S14: tracker EMAs equal an
independent implementation to 1e-9 over a 400-bar random walk) + new
`GET /api/screener/ema-debug?ticker=X` returning each layer's live
EMA6/EMA50/bars/sibling-median (+ observation state) for TV-chart
comparison; verify script now 15 scenarios. Audit found no defects in the
closed-bar/intrabar math beyond the already-fixed WOK classes; known
remaining approximations documented in detection-layers.md (session-blind
sibling window at the open, bars-not-minutes observation).

X4H. **📈 4h EMA-cross layer — the operator's swing-timing tool (2026-07-17).**
Operator showed 4 charts (KYTX/SHPH/CODX/CNTX) of 4h 6/50 crosses preceding
swings and proposed: enter on the 4h cross with a tight stop, exit
discretionary. Clarified scope: THEY keep the entry filter and the exit;
what they need is detection the second the cross happens (not at 4h bar
close). Cross-as-signal remains twice-measured-at-chance — the edge claim
lives in their manual filter, so the layer is graded on lead time + fire
rate, not precision. **Built:** `EmaCrossTracker` parameterized
(`EmaCrossConfig`; events carry `tf`), second instance at `EMA_CROSS_4H`
(interval 14400, buckets anchored to the ET session grid 04:00/08:00/… —
TV's ETH 4h bars; EDT/EST offset recomputed at midnight); intrabar detection
gives second-level cross latency. Warmup (~50 4h bars ≈ 2-3 weeks) is
impossible live → new `bars_4h` table (migration `20260717120000`, 40d
retention) + Databento ohlcv-1h backfill (35d, batched ~100/req via the
generalized `fetchDatabentoAgg`, no Yahoo fallback — MINI-invisible names
have no baseline anyway). **Surfacing: dashboard-only by operator choice**
(4H badge in the EMA CROSS section, rows linger 6h, in-ladder names NOT
skipped — unlike 5m; no Telegram/ping until `tier_events meta.tf='4h'` shows
the real fire rate; expect dozens-to-~100+/day across ~1,500 known runners).
Verify script → 12 scenarios (S12: 4h config, offset grid, tf stamping).
**Day-1 fixes (the WOK phantom cross — THREE stacked root causes, all
found from the operator's first check and fixed same day):**
(1) **Databento end-bound**: the first 120d pass 422'd every chunk —
`get_dataset_range`'s top-level end is the max across schemas and reads
rounded forward, while ohlcv-1h only rolls once an hour; clamp is now to
the PER-SCHEMA end (`databentoSchemaEnd`), plus per-chunk retry instead of
aborting the fleet. (2) **Depth**: 35d backfill ≈ 1× the 4h-EMA50 span →
no convergence; now 120d (~150+ bars), retention/boot-seed 130d, skip rule
= ≥150 banked bars OR history reaching ≥100d back. (3) **Splits** (the one
that actually bit WOK): TV charts are split-ADJUSTED, Databento is raw —
WOK reverse-split ~1:78 Jun 18, so even 212 raw bars gave EMA50 2.00 vs
TV 2.63 and a $2.04 poke "crossed". `adjustSplitHistory` (pure, tested,
applied read-side at seed time; DB keeps raw): overnight UP-jumps ≥4.85×
= split, 1.94–4.85× only within 2.5% of a whole number; DOWN-moves never
(WOK's own -89% overnight crash is real history). Verified on WOK's real
series: adjusted EMA50 2.742 ≈ TV's 2.63, cross condition flips false.
**Grading note: 4h tier_events before ~2026-07-17 14:50 UTC are blind
(scale-broken EMAs) — the 4h trial effectively starts from then.**
**Watch:** (a) fire rate + time-of-day clustering after a few days → pick
Telegram gate (operator deferred: watchlist/screens were the candidates);
(b) confirm semantics on 4h are untuned first-guesses (sibling 12×4h bars,
$10k floor) — nomination is the product, confirms are telemetry;
~~nominations deliberately have NO notional floor~~ **superseded
2026-07-22 (the LBTYK phantom):** a single 1-share odd-lot print at $10.99
vs a $9.97 market ($11 notional!) provisionally "crossed" and nominated —
a print the SIP tape excludes, so TV never saw it. Nominations now need
`nominate_min_notional` $2k of bucket/bar dollars (junk-print guard, all
timeframes; no state consumed on intrabar rejection — real bursts fire
seconds later once dollars accumulate); (c) first boot
pays the full ~15-request Databento pass, subsequent boots seed from
bars_4h.

XINTRA. **📈 intrabar detection — TV-parity, closes the ~5-min lag (2026-07-16,
the DXST/EHGO report).** Operator's TV alerts fired 42–75s INTO the 5m bar
(13:00:42 EHGO, 13:01:15 DXST local); our closed-bar-only evaluation waited
for the bar close (+ next-trade close semantics) → ~4–5 min behind, exactly
as reported. Now every live tick also runs a provisional check: EMAs folded
forward with the current price (closed-bar state never mutated — at a
bucket's final tick the provisional diff equals the closed diff, so the
closed-bar path remains a pure backstop), and confirms may fire MID-BAR on
the bucket's accumulated volume — sound because volume is monotone (anything
clearing a threshold mid-bar clears it at close). The mid-bar cross bar keeps
the 5× instant rule; later bars the 3× rule; notional/price floors unchanged.
Price-side repaint (a poke that un-crosses by close) can nominate a wiggle —
same as the operator's TV alert — and the volume stage disposes of it; watch
the wiggle-nomination rate in grading via `meta.intrabar`. Kill switch:
`EMA_CROSS.intrabar_detect`. Verify script extended to 11 scenarios (S9–S11:
mid-bar nominate→confirm, cross-bar 5×-only rule, floors + cooldown under
intrabar).

XMETA. **📈 layer pre-grading hardening (2026-07-16, two sessions).** Overnight
session: (1) **Databento historical is now the primary EMA backfill** (batched
~100 syms/request, ohlcv-1m→5m locally, same MINI scale as live — kills the
Yahoo volume-scale skew for the primary path; Yahoo stays as per-symbol
fallback for MINI-invisible names; end clamped to `available_end`, the 422
fix); (2) **expired nominations re-arm after a 60-min cooldown** — the
once/ticker/day lock was measured wrong on TGHL (a weak 0.4× cross burned the
slot; the real 6.7× cross ran +20%); a confirm still ends the symbol's day.
Day session: (3) **confirm notional floor** `confirm_min_notional: $10k`
(feed-visible, first guess) on BOTH confirm paths — the sibling floor is 50
*shares*, so a dead-tape "3×" could confirm on ~$200; an instant-confirm
failing it demotes to a nomination; (4) **gradable meta** — tier_events cross
rows now carry `vol`/`sib_median`/`notional` (expire carries `sib_median` so
`peak_ratio` converts to absolute) — bars_5m prunes at 3d, so without this the
grading week couldn't audit confirm quality retroactively; (5) committed
synthetic regression `apps/api/scripts/verify-ema-cross.ts` (8 scenarios:
warmup, both confirm paths, floors, price hold, cooldown, seed silence — the
overnight session's tests had lived in scratch). **Grading note: cross-funnel
semantics changed 2026-07-16 — segment at the date, count per observation.**

QVOL. **🤫 Quiet-accumulation tier — measured, then shipped (2026-07-05).** The operator kept seeing "EMA cross + rising MACD on flat candles" before moves (USDE: cross ~16:00–16:30 ET Jul 1, launch 17:48, NO news until next morning — so the radar couldn't see it, and the EMAMACD2 study anchored on news couldn't either). Decomposed the observation: the carrier is **volume before price**, not the indicator. Verified USDE in our own rows: momentum NEW at 16:04 ET, +6.97%, day-RVol 21×, rv5m 3,119% → every alert path silent for 104 min (all gate on chg≥10 / catalyst / score).
   - **Cohort study (55d, first appearance per ticker/ET-day, `scripts/research/quiet-accum-cohort-v2-fastrv.sql`):** quiet entries (chg<10) split by fast RVol (max rv1m/rv5m in first 5 min — session-independent; ⚠️ v1 with day-RVol was distorted, Finviz day-RV reads ~0 in PM). **Quiet + fastRV≥10× → ≥+20pt continuation 20–25% (AH, n=507) / 12–14% (PM-REG, n=315) vs 3% for quiet-no-vol** — a 3–7× lift. `seen_recently=true` slightly OUTPERFORMS within the cohort (known runner quietly re-loading). Hot (chg≥10) still has higher absolute rates but enters extended — the accum tier's value is the early cheap entry + lead time to the +10% line (USDE 104 min).
   - **Shipped:** `scanAccumulation` in poller (union rows, chg 0–10, fastRV≥1000%, within first 10 min of first sight — the measured entry semantics; once/ticker/day) → LIVE TICKS ladder entry `status='accum'` (🤫 teal). Promotes to 👀 via the detector's watch event (accum entries skip the stale/on-screen suppression) or a screen backstop at chg≥10 (display-only); confirms via normal surge/sustain; `screened_at_watch=true` blocks bogus screen-confirms. TTL 120 min with graded expiry logs. Alerts: soft dashboard ping (quietest tone) for every flag; **Telegram 🤫 only for fastRV≥3000% or accumulation+bullish-news** — once/ticker/day.
   - **v2 tuning (2026-07-07, after day-1 + a 55d feature study — `scripts/research/quiet-accum-features.sql`):** day-1 live: 43 flags, 14 promoted (36%), all 14 finished ≥+10% (BJDX flagged +8.8 → +76.6, GVH +6.0 → +41.1), fizzles peaked ≤+2.6pts. Feature study found the discriminators: **persistence** (hot ≥3 cycles in 5min: 65%/24% vs transient 35%/7%) and **sustained+bullish-news** (72%/30%, ~1.6/day); fastRV *magnitude* ranks nothing (USEA 223× fizzled, BJDX 12× won) — day-1's ≥3000 Telegram pushes were mostly fizzles while both winners were sub-gate. **Shipped:** `min_hot_cycles: 3` persistence gate (expect ~9 flags/day, −40% volume, mostly-fizzle cut) + Telegram re-gated to sustained+bullish-news only (`telegram_rv_min` retired). Sleeper to watch: entry chg 0–5% flags (ignition-side, n=17 in study) ran 82%/76% — rare and golden if it holds live.
   - **WATCH / OPEN:** (a) grade live precision from `grep accum` logs (`↗ 👀 watch` / `🛰️` vs `💤 expired (peak +Xpts)`), tune `ACCUM.fast_rv_min`/`min_hot_cycles` after ~a week; expect ~9 flags/day post-v2. (b) sub-5% ignition-side entries (chg 0–5) are included but were NOT in the measured cohort (momentum's chg≥5 gate) — check their share in the logs. (c) same in-memory restart residual as the rest of the ladder. (d) Phase 2 idea if the tier earns it: detector-side accumulation (volume surge vs quiet baseline while cum<10) for names below the momentum screen's chg≥5 gate — the only truly invisible zone left.

EMAMACD2. **RESEARCH — the conditional EMA/MACD test is now RUN; the book is CLOSED (2026-07-05).** The one salvage path left open by the 07-01 study ("does entering at the cross beat entering at our detection, on catalyst names only?") — measured. **Design:** 1,115 usable detections (momentum ∪ ignition first-per-ticker/ET-day, 55d) that had a bullish-classified article ≤24h before detection; three entries raced per event to a SHARED finish line (news+24h / news+72h peak, right-censored dropped): news-bar entry (radar-style), first EMA6/20×MACD cross after the news (15m + 30m, EMA-only and full confluence), our detection. Yahoo 15m×60d prepost bars; scripts durable this time in `apps/api/scripts/research/` (`ema-macd-conditional-*`).
   - **Verdict — no conditional edge:** paired on the same events, **cross−detection = +0.0 pts median in EVERY subset** (all / impact≥60 / strong-major / premium types, both horizons) and **cross−news = −1.5 to −2.5 pts**. The cross fires ≤24h post-news in only 70% of events, so "wait for the cross" also forfeits 30% of moves entirely — mean capture roughly HALVES vs acting on the news (+16.1% vs +32.7% @24h). Conditioning on catalyst quality does not resurrect the signal anywhere.
   - **The bonus finding that matters:** **news-entry dominates detection-entry across every cut** — @24h median +14.6% vs +6.7%, mean +32.7% vs +17.2%, ≥+20% hit 39% vs 21% (same ordering @72h and in all subsets). News→detection lag: median 351 min, p25 7 min. This is the measured case for the NEWS RADAR (entry NR below): the early edge the operator keeps sensing on charts lives in the CATALYST, not the indicator — the cross is a delayed, lossy proxy for "price moved after news".
   - ⚠️ Caveats: absolute capture levels are survivorship-inflated (every event is a name that eventually screened; radar hits that never move aren't in this sample — the radar's live precision logs remain the unconditional read). The strategy-vs-strategy comparison on shared events is the valid part. Yahoo 15m nano-cap bars are noisy but symmetric across strategies.
   - **Action:** do NOT build EMA/MACD alerts/badges in any form; the radar+tick chain already occupies the only seat where this idea's edge could have lived.

NR. **📰 NEWS RADAR — catalyst-first detection (2026-07-03).** Full spec in web-dashboard.md (top entry). The chain is now: news radar (pre-move) → tick watch (+10% cross) → tick confirm / screens. Zero new API calls — the Benzinga delta was already market-wide; we were discarding the non-screening matches. Benzinga fetch now paginates (≤3×100/cycle; bursts used to drop articles silently past the watermark — verified `page` param live).
   - **Key mechanics:** known-runner set = 30d of momentum/ignition tickers (`seedRadarHistory` boot seed + live growth); dedup by article URL/day; classify via the shared URL cache (LLM refinement upgrades in place, bearish flip drops the entry); radar entries carry a `daily_bars` prior close so `TickFeedService.syncScreenRows` (30s) arms the detector for non-universe names; escalation check runs in the payload build (`screenRowByTicker` / `tickCatches`); session='closed' skipped.
   - **WATCH / OPEN:** (a) **precision unknown until live** — the DB couldn't measure how many headlines lead nowhere; after ~1 week: `docker compose logs api | grep news-radar` → hit rate = `↗ moving` / (`↗ moving` + `💤 expired (no move)`), per catalyst type/impact band; then tune display gates (currently ALL non-bearish shown) + the Telegram gate (strong/major). (b) expect **premarket 8:00–9:30 ET burst** — if the section floods, add a `min_impact` display gate (`NEWS_RADAR` const). (c) radar entries are in-memory (deploy loses them; `radarSeenUrls` dedup also resets → a deploy can re-radar an active article — same known residual as tick catches). (d) marketContext is null at classify time (no live float/mcap for non-screening names) → hype skews low until the LLM pass lands.

COVER. **Tick coverage + EMA warmup fully closed (2026-07-15, the TGHL case).** TGHL (prior close $0.66) ignited premarket; ignition screen caught it at +28.5% but the per-second tiers first saw it at +91% — it sat below the momentum filter's $1 floor and the tick universe derived ONLY from the momentum filter. Three fixes same day: (1) **universe union** — tick subscriptions now cover momentum's structural band ∪ the ignition band (`sh_price_u10`), ~3,450+ symbols, two Finviz exports 1.3s apart; (2) **bars_5m persistence + boot replay** — live closed 5m bars persist (3d retention), boots replay 48h, so the 📈 layer's 50-bar warmup survives deploys (three 07-14 deploys had left it silent all of 07-15); (3) **Yahoo 5m backfill** — known runners below ~50 banked bars fetch free Yahoo history (1/2s, once/symbol/day, rescan 4h; direct-seeds only never-streamed symbols; consolidated-vs-MINI volume-scale caveat documented, self-heals in ~1h). Also corrected on the record: TGHL-class moves with a preparatory 5m bar ARE EMA-catchable (~+28%, on par with ignition) — the earlier "not catchable" claim was wrong; only pure gaps cross one bar late. **The 📈 trial runs with full infrastructure from 07-16.** Full layer reference: `docs/detection-layers.md`.

NEWSDAY. **🔥 icons no longer vanish at midnight ET (2026-07-10, the VRAX report).** Operator: "tickers don't show the fire icon even when there's news." Data showed the real bug: at 00:00 ET the poller cleared its news caches and "today's news" became the new (empty) calendar day — ignition rows went 174/174-with-catalyst at 23h ET → 0/174 at 00h, while the board still shows the finished day's change% until premarket. For a UTC+5 operator, 00:00–04:00 ET is prime review time. **Fix:** the NEWS day rolls at **04:00 ET** (premarket start) — Finviz/Yahoo/Benzinga/halt today-filters + headline/classification caches follow `newsDayEt`; alert dedups, watermarks, and per-day trading state stay midnight-anchored. Related display nuance recorded: a row's flame reflects the source-precedence headline (halt > sec > bz > yahoo > finviz), so a 46-score LULD halt can front a better PR — the modal has the full list. Also that day: Benzinga multi-ticker "why is it moving" blurbs carry ONE representative ticker's quote-page URL — single-ticker news lists now rewrite `/quote/<sym>` links to the viewed ticker (the SOC→SKYQ case).

XCROSS. **📈 EMA-cross layer — the operator's manual TV loop, automated (2026-07-10).** Operator (5th EMA raise, now with the right architecture): EMA(6/50) bullish cross on **5m bars** over the known-runner set NOMINATES a ticker for a ~30-min observation; it CONFIRMS only if a closed bar's volume runs ≥3× the sibling median (prior hour's bars) with price ≥ cross×1.005 — or instantly if the cross bar itself arrives ≥5×; no expansion → silent expire. This matches the twice-measured verdict: the cross has no selection power (it's the *nominator*), volume-expansion is the carrier (the *confirmer*). Built on tick-feed per-second bars aggregated in-process (`services/ema-cross.ts`, `EMA_CROSS` knobs) — zero API calls. Sidebar section 📈 EMA CROSS (dim "…observing" → green "✅ N× vol"), soft ping + browser notif on CONFIRM only, no Telegram until graded. `tier_events` tier='cross' (nominate/confirm/expire, with `in_ladder` when LIVE TICKS already had the name — those skip display). **Caveats:** (a) ~~EMAs need 50 closed bars after each deploy~~ **FIXED 2026-07-15**: closed bars persist to `bars_5m` and boot replays 48h — warmup survives deploys (see the deferred-list entry). (b) Sparse tapes close bars late (bar closes on the next trade — TV-like). (c) Fire rate unknown — grade nominate→confirm/expire rates + confirmed forward outcomes from tier_events after ~a week; knobs: `confirm_vol_x`, `sibling_min_sh`, `observe_bars`, `warmup_bars`. **Follow-up fix (2026-07-15, the OPTX confusion):** row timestamps now use the BAR's close time (TV labels bars by OPEN — a 5m skew read as a missed detection) and the row's "ago" always anchors on the cross ("cross 20m ago"). Day-1 funnel: 37 nominations → 13 confirms (35%) / 14 expires.

ACCUM2. **Detector-side 🤫 — the sub-screen accumulation tier (2026-07-08, the SLS case).** Operator raised EMA/MACD a fourth time with a real win: their 1h TV cross alerted SLS at 09:25 ET (+3%), our first signal was the 👀 at 09:41 (+10.2%). Diagnosis: SLS **never hit any screen** (day-RVol never cleared momentum's 5× Finviz gate; $14 ≫ ignition's sub-$1), so the screen-scanning accum tier was blind and the tick feed's first word is the +10% watch — a structural sub-10% blind zone for unscreened names. **Built the queued phase 2:** the tick DETECTOR now emits an `accum` event when cum ∈ [3%, 10%) AND trailing volume ≥3× its own quiet baseline, SUSTAINED 120s (the measured persistence lesson), with the junk floor + near-high checks (`TICK_DETECT.accum_*`). Rides the existing ladder (teal 🤫 row, promotes at the +10% cross, confirm/TTL/tier_events with `meta.source='tick'` vs `'screen'`); dashboard-only — no Telegram until tier_events grades this source. Also fixed a latent baseline bug found on the way: surge windows below mom_min used to feed the "quiet" baseline and self-dampen (an accumulation burst at +4% polluted its own reference); quiet sampling now excludes ≥3× windows. Regression: identical watch/confirm timings, false-confirms 1/38 unchanged, 0 accums on the fizzler control, gappers correctly produce no accum (hold unmeetable at their speed). **Watch:** detector-accum volume/day unknown — grade `tier_events WHERE tier='accum' AND meta->>'source'='tick'` after a few days; dial `accum_relvol_min` 3→5 if noisy.

SEEDT. **seedTierState() — the live tier state now survives deploys too (2026-07-15).** tier_events made the *record* durable; this closes the *working memory* half: on boot the poller replays today's tier_events in order, rebuilding the LIVE TICKS ladder (accum/watch/confirmed inside TTLs), NEWS RADAR entries, confirmed EMA crosses, AND all once-per-day dedup sets (accumSeen, alertedTickWatch/Catch, alertedAccum via bullish_news, alertedNewsRadar + radarSeenUrls) — so a mid-session deploy no longer blanks the sidebar or re-pings names (the AUID residual, closed). Deliberate limits: reseeded 'observing' cross rows are DROPPED (their tracker-side observation died with the old process — only confirmed crosses persist); detector internals (quiet baselines) and EMA warmup (~4h of 5m bars) still rebuild live — bar persistence is the remaining piece, only worth it if the cross layer graduates. Radar hit meta now records `urgency` for faithful reseeds.

TIEREV. **tier_events table — grading now survives deploys (2026-07-07).** Found while answering "are all components working?": every CI deploy recreates the api container and WIPES docker logs — four deploys that day erased the tier-grading evidence four times (the SOC radar hit was only reconstructible from the DB). New `tier_events` table (migration `20260707200000`): every 🤫/👀/🛰️/📰 transition the poller used to only console.log is now also inserted fire-and-forget (`services/tier-events.ts`, error-throttled, never blocks a cycle). Events: accum flag/promote/expire · tick watch/watch_suppressed/confirm/fade/watch_expired · radar hit/moving/expired/dropped, each with a meta jsonb (chg, rel_vol, mom, via, pts, minutes, impact, reason…). **Grading is now SQL over any date range** — e.g. accum precision: `SELECT count(*) FILTER (WHERE event='promote') … FROM tier_events WHERE tier='accum'`; evidence-gate audit: suppressed-low-evidence tickers that later confirm. Also finally closes the "tick catches are display-only / no persistence" open item. Console logs kept (live tailing).

TICKW-EV. **Watch-tier evidence gate (2026-07-07, the drift-crosser fix).** Operator: "is it OK every watch-ticker already extended?" — LIVE TICKS showed VSTM/ADCT/FBRX/BZFD, all +10-14% via hours-long grinds (ADCT multi-day), all crossing at ≤2× rv and ~0%/60s mom. Same class as day-1's RIOT/CLSK/JOBY sector-drift spam (~80 👀 pushes that day). **Fix:** a watch must show evidence AT the cross — `rel_vol ≥ 3×` its own quiet baseline OR `mom ≥ 3%/60s` (`TICK_WATCH_EVIDENCE`, poller). Gated in the POLLER, not the detector: the anchor still plants, so surge/sustain confirms remain fully live for suppressed names (BFLY/FBGL-style late bloomers still 🛰️). Every day-1 watch that mattered passed the gate; suppressions are logged (`low evidence at cross`) so the gate's cost is auditable — check for `suppressed — low evidence` names that later confirm.

TICKW-AH. **After-hours tick-feed blind spot closed (2026-07-03, the UPC case).** Operator: "Momentum showed UPC 38 min before the live-feed — is that OK?" Reconstructed: UPC hit Momentum 16:03 ET; the news-radar deploy landed 16:33 (mid-AH) and reset subscriptions; detector's FIRST UPC bar was 16:33 at +55% → stale watch (suppressed, correctly) → sustain-confirm 16:37. Most of the gap was the deploy reset (known residual), BUT it exposed a standing hole: `syncScreenRows` skipped AH rows entirely (their change/price are today-close anchored), so an AH runner outside the frozen-after-4pm universe was invisible to the detector for its whole run. **Fix:** AH screen rows now subscribe with a `daily_bars` close as the anchor (same as radar arming; `pendingPrior` dedupes lookups). Also stopped mixing anchors in LIVE TICKS rows/alerts during AH (UPC showed "⚑ +56%" beside "+29.11%" — prior-day vs today-close): AH refresh updates price only.

TICKW. **Tick feed two-tier: 👀 WATCH → 🛰️ CONFIRMED (2026-07-02).** Operator: "when I get the tick catch they're already 30–50% up — RelVol on nano-caps arrives too late; flag by change% first, confirm/remove when volume shows." Prod near-miss logs (last 7d) confirmed three lateness mechanisms: **no-baseline gappers can NEVER fire** (LHAI +238%, EHGO +120%, USDE +168% — quiet sampling stops at cum≥8%, so 0-quiet names are invisible all session), **relvol≥5× clears 20–30 pts after price** (DSY +23% @1.8× → fired +56.7%; SDEV +19% → +47.6%), **slow grinders never trip mom≥8%/60s**. Catches fired at +23–63% (median ~+40).
   - **Built:** `tick-detect.ts` is now a per-symbol state machine (idle→watching→confirmed|faded; full detail in web-dashboard.md). WATCH = cum ≥10% (≤100) + near-high + junk floor (≥5 prints & ≥$2k notional/2min — kills the "+15% on 5 shares" prints). CONFIRM = old surge rule (unchanged — strict superset) | baseline-free sustain (≥2min + ext ≥3pts + ≥flag price + ≥$25k since flag) | screen pickup (poller payload build promotes watch entries that appear in momentum/ignition). FADE = 15min or 60% giveback; surge rule can resurrect a faded name. Watches suppressed for already-screened names (redundant + would self-confirm). Also `syncScreenRows()` in tickfeed.ts (30s) — subscribes current screen rows instantly w/ row-derived prior closes (not in AH — anchor shifts), closing the 10-min universe-lag "0 quiet" hole.
   - **Alerts tiered (operator asked for a watch alert too):** 👀 Telegram + soft dashboard ping on watch; 🛰️ Telegram + radar ping on confirm; each once/ticker/ET-day. UI: LIVE TICKS rows amber (watch, "👀 pending") / blue (confirmed, `⚑ +N%` shows the flag point) / grey faded (3-min linger). `/health.tickfeed` now reports watches/candidates/fades/extra_subs.
   - **Fix (same day, the AUID miss):** v1 suppressed ANY watch on an already-screened name — but a non-catalyst momentum row generates no push, so suppressing the watch left the sustain-confirm at +18.3% as the operator's FIRST AUID signal (momentum had it at +9.5%, watch fired +13.9% → eaten). Now the detector tags each watch `fresh_cross` (did we observe the symbol trade below the 10% line before crossing, vs first-sight-already-above) and suppression only applies to STALE crosses on screened names (the deploy-boot / mid-move-subscribe flood case). Fresh crosses alert even when screened; for those, `screened_at_watch` blocks the screen-pickup promotion (pre-existing screen presence ≠ fresh volume evidence — they confirm via surge/sustain only). Boot race closed too: before the first poll cycle lands, screen state is unknown (`lastPayload` null) → stale watches suppress (first deploy re-pinged CWD +87%). Known residual: the alert-dedup sets are memory-only, so a mid-session deploy can re-ping a name already alerted earlier that day (ties into open items c/d — restart-seeding / persistence).
   - **Fix 2 (same day, CETX/CLRO operator review):** (1) LIVE TICKS rows now refresh price/chg from the screens each cycle — a watch row frozen at flag values ($3.88/+38.6%) read as broken beside the Ignition row at +106% (CETX); the ⚑ marker carries the flag point. (2) ⚑ shows whenever `watch_change_pct` is known and differs from current chg — CLRO's Telegram said "flagged at +14%" but the UI hid it (direct-confirm entries had `caught_at === confirmed_at`). (3) **Express sustain lane** — `confirm_fast_hold_sec` 30 + `confirm_fast_ext_pts` 20: a move that extends ≥20pts beyond the flag on ≥$25k doesn't sit out the full 120s hold (CETX was "pending" at +106%). Regression: CIIT confirms ~2min earlier, control false-confirms unchanged (1/38). Note the CLRO pattern: a T3 halt-resume has no below-line tape, so its watch classifies stale → suppressed; the ⚡ ignition alert (+10.6%, catalyst path) is the early signal there — by design.
   - **Regression (data/dbpull, `npx tsx scripts/verify-tick-detect.ts`):** previously-uncatchable gappers INHD/SUNE/CIIT/PPCB now confirm via sustain; watch flags 17–114s pre-Finviz at lower chg; false-confirms on the 38-fizzler control 1/38 (3%, was ~5%); 3/4 fizzler watches faded on their own. Synthetic edge tests (junk floor, giveback fade, faded→surge resurrect, cum_max cap) all pass.
   - **WATCH / OPEN:** (a) **live alert volume** — expect ~10–20 👀/day; if spammy raise `watch_cum_min` 10→12 or the junk floor, or drop the 👀 Telegram (keep dashboard) — `TICK_DETECT` consts + `formatTickWatchAlert` call site. (b) **$ knobs are EQUS.MINI feed-visible dollars** (fraction of consolidated tape) — first guesses; recalibrate `watch_floor_notional`/`confirm_notional_min` from a few days of `[tickfeed]` watch/confirm/fade logs. (c) watch→confirm→fade **transition telemetry is log-only** — the outcome-tracking open item (000000.a) now matters more: grade watches AND confirms vs forward returns. (d) tick catches still display-only (no float/catalyst enrichment, no DB persistence).

EMAMACD. **RESEARCH (not shipped) — EMA/MACD confluence has no standalone edge (2026-07-01).** Operator's manual TV strategy, investigated because many of our names "jump every few days" and his indicator seemed to lead our ignition. **Exact signal (locked from the TV MACD source):** on 30m or 1h — `crossover(EMA6, EMA20)` AND `hist>=0 AND hist>hist[1]` (the dark-green `#26a69a` histogram = above signal + expanding) AND `macd>macd[1]` (MACD line rising). Zero-line NOT required.
   - **Method (free, reproducible — scripts were in the session scratchpad, now gone; re-derive from this):** Yahoo chart API `query1.finance.yahoo.com/v8/finance/chart/{TICKER}?interval=30m|1h&range=60d&includePrePost=true` (works locally, no auth). Universe = our ignition-history tickers (`ignition_results`, last 40d, one row/(ticker,ET-day) with `min(polled_at)` = our first detection, `max(change_pct)` = peak). **v1 lead-time** on 120 known movers (peak≥20%): does the signal fire in the 48h before our detection, and how early. **v2 precision** on all 472: from every fire, forward peak over 24h/72h vs a random-bar baseline (every 15th bar), right-censoring dropped.
   - **v1 (lead):** 30m confluence fired before **68%** of ignitions, **median ~15h early** (30m EMA-only 73%/14h; 1h ~52–57%/~16h). Looks great in isolation — but that's the trap.
   - **v2 (precision) — the verdict:** P(≥50% peak in 72h | fire) = **7.4–7.7%** (all TF/variants) vs **random-bar baseline 8.1–8.4%**. i.e. **~0.9× baseline — at or slightly BELOW chance.** Same at ≥20/≥30%, 24h/72h. The signal fires ~0.5–0.6×/ticker/day, so there's almost always a recent cross before any move (that's the "leads 68%"), but it does NOT concentrate moves better than random. The clean LGO/DXF/BTCT charts are **survivorship bias**. Slightly-below-baseline fits the operator's own "chasing/continuation is weak" thesis — an EMA cross means the first leg already happened.
   - **On the two sub-questions:** MACD confluence vs EMA-only cuts alert *volume* ~20% (0.49 vs 0.61 fires/tk/day) with **identical** hit rate — filters quantity, not quality. 30m fires ~2× as often as 1h (0.61 vs 0.27) for the **same** edge.
   - **Conclusion:** do NOT ship as a standalone signal/alert (firehose at base-rate accuracy — the "too many alerts" the operator already felt). "Measure first" saved building noise.
   - ~~**OPEN (the one salvage path):** conditional test~~ → **RUN 2026-07-05, negative — see entry EMAMACD2 above. Book closed.**

FLT. **Float filter bug — momentum silently capped at 100M (found + FIXED 2026-06-23).** Operator: "ILLR didn't appear; I raised Max float to 200M but still nothing." There are TWO float controls: the Finviz `sh_float_u<bucket>` token in the filter *string* and the code-side `float_max_m` post-filter (finviz.ts). `FiltersDialog.floatBucket()` mapped Max-float to Finviz's "under" presets which **cap at 100M** (`[1,5,10,20,50,100]`) and on no-match fell back to 100 — so Max-float=200 emitted `sh_float_u100`, and Finviz dropped ILLR (float **177.5M**) before `float_max_m=200` ever applied. Also violated CLAUDE.md ("never put Float in the Finviz filter string" — it drops null-float nano-caps; the code DEFAULTS correctly omit it). **Fix:** (1) live config PATCHed to drop `sh_float_u100` → ILLR shows now (verified #1 in a Finviz probe; it was +296% today, passed price/relvol/change — only the 100M cap excluded it). (2) `buildFilter()` no longer emits any `sh_float` token — float ceiling is solely `float_max_m` (expresses any value); removed the unused `floatBucket`/`FLOAT_FINVIZ_BUCKETS`; added a "enforced server-side — any value works" hint on the Max-float field. **Note:** the dialog rebuilds the whole filter string on submit, so a future Max-float edit will no longer re-introduce the cap.

AHMOM. **After-hours Momentum fix — same volume gate (2026-06-23).** Operator: "AH momentum has too many tickers without volume — BLIV, GRAN." Same root cause as the AH ignition fix below: `toAfterHoursFilter()` drops the momentum filter's `sh_relvol_o5` gate (Finviz freezes relvol at the close). The `ta_change_5to`→`ah_change_5to` change gate *does* work (every row had AH change ≥5%), but with no volume gate, names that ticked >5% on a *handful of AH shares* flooded in (live: **BLIV +6.8% on 5 shares, GRAN +8.4% on 90 shares, FEBO +5.3% on 2 shares** — rv5m≈0; vs real movers NEXR 6.9M/rv5m 6049, RCT 4.5M, DLHC 268K). **Fix:** AH-only filter on the momentum payload `rows` (poller `~1432`) — keep a row only if `max(rel_vol_5min, rel_vol_1min) ≥ AH_MOMENTUM.rvol_min` (default **100** = 1×) OR it's freshly-appeared (cold-start via `first_seen_at`, within `AH_MOMENTUM.cold_start_ms`=2min). Filters only the displayed list, not `enriched` (so catalyst banners/alerts are untouched). Tune via the `AH_MOMENTUM` const. Mirrors the ignition gate.

AHIG. **After-hours Ignition fix — re-impose the volume gate (2026-06-23).** Operator: "is the ignition list working in AH?" Diagnosed **degraded**: `toAfterHoursFilter()` (finviz.ts) drops `sh_relvol_o2` in AH (Finviz freezes relative volume at the 4pm close) and `sh_curvol_o500` then filters on *frozen regular-session* volume — so the volume-led screen pulled in flat, low-volume names (live evidence: LNKS +4%/0.2×, SCNI 0%/0.2×, BIAF +0.6%/0.27×; ~31% of 3-day AH ignition rows had relvol<2). Display was fine (the v=152 AH change/price overlay works) — only *selection* was wrong. **Fix:** AH-only code post-filter on *established* ignition rows requiring our own AH-aware RVol — `max(rel_vol_5min, rel_vol_1min) ≥ IGNITION.ah_rvol_min` (default **100** = 1×); `is_new` rows are exempt (cold-start, RVol not measurable in the first ~75s, inside the 2-min new window). rv5m/1min come from the AH volume deltas, so they read ~0 for junk and 100s–10000s for real movers (VTAK 5264, HSCS 69929) — a clean split. `poller.ts` ~line 1300. **Tune:** `IGNITION.ah_rvol_min` (raise to prune harder). Regular/PM sessions unaffected. **Watch:** confirm the dead names drop from the AH sidebar; the runner-score already ranks the survivors.

TJ. **Trade Journal — IBKR import + Tradervue-style P&L calendar 📅 (2026-06-21, LIVE ON PROD + VALIDATED).** New top-level `/journal` page (header Dashboard|Journal switch). Drag-drop an IBKR TradeLog `.tlg` → server parses + dedupes + stores; a month P&L calendar (net/gross toggle, green/red day cells with trade counts, weekly + monthly totals, month summary strip); click a day → round-trip drill-down. The calendar auto-lands on the most recent month with trades (and jumps to the imported month after an import) so importing an older statement isn't an empty grid.
   - **Model:** `broker_imports` (file meta + sha256) + `trade_executions` (one row/fill, `UNIQUE(user_id, exec_id)` → idempotent re-import; free-form text cols are `text` — IBKR open/close can be a sub-code like `C;IA`, venue can be a list). Round-trip *trades* are **derived in code** (`services/ibkr-tlg.ts` `matchTrades`), not stored — flat-to-flat per symbol, P&L `−Σamount` (`+Σcommission` net), attributed to the **exit date** (overnight holds land on close day). Routes under `/api/trades` (import/calendar/day/range/imports + DELETE). `express.json` limit 100kb→5mb.
   - **Validated on prod:** the operator imported real **May + June** statements — **gross P&L matches their Tradervue to the penny** (May −$98.03, June $327.88); net within ~4¢ (per-trade cents rounding vs TV's sum-then-round — not a logic gap; commission totals agree to ~1¢). Day cells use compact whole-dollar formatting; the header keeps full cents. An integration test vs Postgres confirms import → dedup → calendar → drill-down.
   - **Shipped as 3 pushes:** feature (`ebaabcd`) + fix: widen text cols for `C;IA` open/close (`37235b6`) + fix: calendar lands on the month with data (`9a9a33e`).
   - **NEXT / OPEN:** (a) **the payoff (next big step)** — join trades to `screener_outcomes` + detections on `(ticker, et_date)` for per-trade screener attribution (the "analyze the whole process" report). (b) Only IBKR `.tlg` STK_TRD parsed (options/futures records ignored). (c) One overnight trade's *count* differs from Tradervue by 1 (they also tally it on the open day); P&L unaffected. (d) Optional: make net penny-exact (sum raw, round once) — currently ~4¢/mo off TV.
   - Aside: **charts investigation** (can the TV embed show 1s/10s off the Databento feed?) — **no** (closed iframe fetches its own 15-min-delayed data; free embed floors at 1-min). Path = Lightweight Charts aggregating our 1s feed, but needs bar capture+SSE+persistence. Written up in web-dashboard.md "TradingView free embed widget". Deferred.

000000. **Live tick-feed early-ignition detector 🛰️ — BUILT, ACTIVATED, VALIDATED, + Option B shipped (2026-06-17→18).** Databento EQUS.MINI per-second feed catches an ignition START 30–90s before Finviz. Subscribed Standard/US-Equities ($199/mo flat, live EQUS.MINI included, $0 metered), `TICKFEED_ENABLED=true` on the droplet, stream/CRAM-auth works, healthy at scale (2.6k symbols, ~300k bars/day, no errors). **First prod win: MNTS caught 20 min before the momentum screen.** Additive edge — big wins on relvol-gated slow-burns, ties/trails on fast-starters Finviz's change gate catches.
   - **Option B (`3903b9e`, live): tick catches go to the DASHBOARD, not Telegram.** A pinned **🛰️ LIVE TICKS** section atop the Ignition sidebar (`payload.tick_catches`, blue palette, `TickItem`); `onTickCandidate` records to a `tickCatches` Map (no push), pruned when a screen catches the name up or after a 15-min TTL. **Telegram rebalanced**: 🚀 fresh-burst + 🆕 new-ignition pushes SILENCED (dormant, easy re-enable — those names already show in the sidebar); Telegram now high-conviction only (≥65 ignition, momentum strong/major catalyst, dual-signal, swing).
   - ⚠️ **Git incident (2026-06-18):** a working-tree revert of Option B briefly made the code *look* alert-only — but `3903b9e` was committed/pushed/deployed. **Check origin/commits, not just the working tree.** Tree restored + clean.
   - ⚠️→✅ **DEPLOY-KILLS-THE-FEED bug (found + FIXED 2026-06-22).** The feed silently died after the 06-21 deploys — `/health.tickfeed` showed `running:true` but `bars_seen:0, symbols_tracked:0, last_error:null` for ~21h. Root cause: Databento `BentoError: User has reached their open connection limit`. On a CI deploy the new container's sidecar tried to connect while the old one still held the Databento Live slot → limit hit → the sidecar's retry loop created a fresh `db.Live()` each attempt **without closing the old one** → leaked connections pinned the limit forever. Leak lives in-process, so `docker compose restart api` recovers it (used as the immediate recovery; verified bars flowed). **Fix shipped:** sidecar now closes the client in a `finally`, handles SIGTERM/SIGINT to cleanly release the session on container stop (frees the slot for the next container → no deploy overlap), backs off 30s on the connection-limit error so an overlapping session drains, and surfaces errors to `/health.tickfeed.last_error`; `tickfeed.ts` chunks the `SUB` into 400-symbol lines (fixes the "unknown command: …" fragmentation), re-`sync()`s ~3s after each spawn (respawned sidecars no longer wait up to 10 min for a SUB), and clears `last_error` when bars resume. **Operational check after any deploy:** confirm `/health.tickfeed.bars_seen` climbs within ~1–2 min; the fix should self-heal the overlap, but `docker compose restart api` remains the manual recovery if it ever wedges.
   - ⚠️→✅ **CATCHES INVISIBLE IN THE UI (found + FIXED 2026-06-23).** Operator: "I didn't see it working." The detector was firing fine (11+ catches/day — WETO/MGRX/VTAK/ENTX…) but the 🛰️ LIVE TICKS section was ~always empty. Root cause: the payload-build pruned a catch the instant `screened.has(ticker)` was true, and the **volume-led Ignition screen (no change gate) absorbs the same surge within a cycle or two** → each catch flashed for only seconds (confirmed: VTAK caught 20:20:59Z, in the Ignition list ~16 min later). **Fix:** dropped the screened-prune; catches now persist a rolling 15-min TTL window regardless of screen state (a name showing in BOTH LIVE TICKS and Ignition is the point — proves the tick feed flagged it first). `poller.ts` ~line 1387. No type/UI change. **Net: the tick feed's real lead is over the change-gated *Momentum* screen, not the volume-led Ignition screen — so LIVE TICKS is best read as "recent early catches," not a strict pre-screen queue.**
   - 🔔 **NOTIFICATIONS ADDED (2026-06-23) — partially reverses Option B.** Operator missed RDGT while away 10 min: tick catches had NO notification (dashboard-only, glance-only). Now every new catch fires **both** a Telegram push (🛰️, reaches the phone when away — `formatTickCatchAlert` in `poller.ts`, once/ticker/ET-day via `alertedTickCatch`, gated on `telegramEnabled && !alertsMuted`) **and** a dashboard sound + browser notification (`radarPing` + `notify` in `useScreenerAlerts.ts`, deduped via a `seenTicks` ref so a 15-min-persisting catch pings once). Operator chose "every catch" (~11/day) — no strength filter. If it gets noisy, add a rel-vol/momentum threshold in `onTickCandidate` (Telegram) and/or filter `newTicks` (dashboard); `/alerts off` mutes the Telegram side. The slower ≥65/dual/swing paths can still fire later for the same name (independent dedup) — intentional (more context), watch for double-pings.
   - **STILL OPEN (next session):** (a) no forward-outcome tracking for tick catches — instrument into `screener_outcomes`-style grading to prove the edge over time; (b) HAO-style re-surge suppression — watch whether catches on already-long-visible names feel noisy; (c) deploys reset detector baselines (even web-only) — add restart-seeding like ignition/VWAP; (d) tick catches are display-only (no float/catalyst/shelf enrichment, no DB persistence). Detail in [[tick_feed_scoping]] memory + the original build entry below.

000000b. **Tick feed — original build entry (behind a flag, pre-activation).** Databento EQUS.MINI per-second feed → catch ignition START 30–90s before Finviz. Offline-validated ($0 free credit): rel-volume (not $) separates real ignitions (9.8–100× baseline) from blips (0.3–0.7×); DSY/GLXG/BYAH caught 15–90s early at far lower chg; gappers (INHD/RGNT) uncatchable; 3–5% false-fire on fizzlers. Pieces: `tick-detect.ts` (pure causal detector, verified by `scripts/verify-tick-detect.ts`), `sidecar/tickfeed.py` (official `databento` Live client — no Node client exists; fields verified vs 0.80), `tickfeed.ts` (spawns sidecar, feeds detector), `poller.onTickCandidate` (🛰️ alert, mutually exclusive w/ other alert paths), universe prior-close extension, Dockerfile (runtime → Debian slim + python3 + databento; **image built+verified locally, 767MB**). **ALL behind `TICKFEED_ENABLED` (default off).** ✅ **Go-live DONE** (subscription + flag + smoke-test all complete — see entry 000000 above). Ceiling: recovers Finviz's lag on *ramping* runners, can't catch *gappers* (the biggest movers). Full detail in web-dashboard.md + [[tick_feed_scoping]] memory.

00000. **Ignition restart-seeding + 🆕 new-ignition alert + 2 removals (2026-06-16).**
   (1) `seedIgnitionState()` on boot rebuilds `ignitionFirstSeen` + alert-dedup
   sets from today's `ignition_results` — fixes deploys flashing the whole list
   as "new" and re-blasting alerts (same restart-safe pattern as
   firstSeen/VWAP). (2) New 🆕 alert for a recently-appeared ignition (≤15 min
   old) building into the 40–64 band (chg 10–100, non-bearish, dedup/day,
   skips already-🚀/≥65) — fills the gap between fresh-burst (≤5M) and the ≥65
   alert that fires hours late. ~6–8/day; dial `NEW_IGNITION.alert_score`.
   (3) Removed Universe News tab + `/feed?universe=true`, and the Quote-Details
   Ignition sub-tab + `/ignition-history` endpoint.

0000. **Ignition float cap 15→25M (2026-06-15).** CAST (16.5M → +364%) was
   excluded from ignition entirely. 10-day study: 15–25M band runs as hard as
   2–5M, harder than 10–15M (34% vs 14% reach +40%); 25–50M falls off → 25M
   ceiling. Paired change: `IGNITION.float_max_m 15→25` + runner-score ladder
   `<25M→6` (cap + score must move together or raised names never reach the 65
   line). ~4.7 new ignition-eligible names/day. fresh-burst stays ≤5M
   (nano-float validation doesn't transfer). **Watch:** grade the 15–25M band
   vs `screener_outcomes` once mature; the 82-row study was a momentum proxy.

000. **Swing score v2 — "early volatile breakout" (2026-06-13).** Operator
   review confirmed by outcomes: old score was INVERTED (alert set ≥65 had the
   LOWEST upside, peak_5d +2.8 vs +8.4 for sub-50; mature-trend/at-high/
   tight-base rewards all backwards; ATR unscored). v2: Volatility(25, ATR%) +
   Room(15, below-52w-high) + Trigger(30, day-1/2 FRESH 15-bar-high cross +
   15-bar base + close) + Volume(15) + Trend(10 nudge, reversals allowed) +
   Catalyst(10) + Extension(−15..0) + Shelf. Alert ≥60 + fresh cross.
   Reconstruction-validated: ≥60 → peak5 +12.1, 17%≥+20, 7%≥+40, ~3.5/day.
   ⚠️ breakdown keys + flag semantics changed 2026-06-13 (broke_out = day-1
   fresh cross); old/new swing scores not comparable across the date. chg_5d
   negative everywhere — score targets peak capture, not passive holds.
   **Watch:** let new-score outcomes mature ≥5d before judging; expect ~2-4
   alerts/day.

00. **Fresh-burst alert 🚀 (2026-06-12, after the RVol study).** Catches the
   "new ticker rallying from the very beginning" case (DSY: +10→+47% before the
   screens even returned it; ignition alert structurally too slow — vol
   component needs the 5-min read, PM penalty −8 kept DSY at 64<65). New
   `pushFreshBurstAlerts` over the enriched union, first 3 min after first
   sight: float ≤5M, chg 10–80, `max(rv1m,rv5m) ≥ 8000` (or day-RVol ≥30 in
   REG — day-RVol is *useless in PM*, measured), PM+REG only, once/ticker/day.
   Plus 1-min RVol cold start (~20s, second cycle). Sim: ~12.7/day, med +13pts
   in 30min after alert, 47% ≥+15pts; catches DSY/CUPR/ASBP (+77/+76/+39).
   Knobs in `FRESH_BURST` (`poller.ts`). **Watch live alert volume the first
   PM/REG sessions — if spammy, raise `rvol_fast_min` 8000→10000 (15000 loses
   DSY).**

0. **RVol study + fixes (2026-06-12, committed after the ignition recalibration).**
   Reviewed Momentum's Heat + 5-min-RVol pipeline against an 8-day offline
   replay of prod per-cycle series (965k rows, simulation validated 0.995 vs
   stored). Found + fixed: **(a)** the "5-min" RVol anchor drifted to the 600s
   history cap for any name tracked >5 min — a ~10-min window, median **2.04×
   inflated** (⚠️ **scale break: rows before 2026-06-12 carry the old scale**;
   ignition volume tiers halved to 1500/500/250/100 to compensate); **(b)** new
   **`rel_vol_1min`** end-to-end (column, persisted both tables, alerts meta) —
   at matched alert rates it flags 43% of imminent surges vs 28% for the old
   metric, equal precision, and 1m+5m both-hot is the strongest live tell
   (59.5% vs 30.7% base); **(c)** Heat's RVol ladder was saturated (80% of rows
   cleared tier 1) — re-anchored to measured percentiles + a +6 both-windows
   burst bonus. Details in web-dashboard.md "Recent additions". **Watch:** Heat
   distribution shifts (RVol tiers now actually differentiate) and ignition
   scores for *established* names sit slightly lower on the corrected metric —
   don't re-judge the recalibration off the first day or two; the 1m/5m
   "drying-up" ratio (t1/t5 < 0.5 → cooling) is a measured candidate for a
   future exit-assist.

1. **Finviz rate-limit fix (the big one, 2026-06-11).** Swing tab was empty.
   Root cause: **Finviz Elite ceiling is ~1 req/s** (measured: a 2nd call 300ms
   after the 1st 429s), and we blew past it — daily-bars drained 60 calls/min +
   the poller's concurrent per-cycle burst. Swing (last screen each cycle) lost
   the race → 429 → empty. Fixes: daily-bars drain `1s→4s` (`daily-bars.ts`);
   **global `rateLimitGate()` in `finviz.ts` spacing ALL Finviz HTTP ≥1.1s
   apart**; typed `FinvizRateLimitError` (429 no longer silently "no rows");
   bounded swing empty-retry (2 min) in `poller.ts`. Verified: 429s ~30/min→0,
   swing repopulated. See `docs/web-dashboard.md` incident report.
   - Debug-log cleanup done 2026-06-13: the per-refresh `swing fetch —` log is
     removed; the `swing scan empty —` warn was **kept deliberately** — it
     fires only on the failure case (and now carries the fetch error).
2. **Continuation demoted → "Faders" (2026-06-11).** Outcome data: the
   continuation pattern is a NEGATIVE long signal (−2.4%/28% win over 5d vs
   +3.2%/39% for fresh names). Moved tab to last, relabeled "Faders", banner
   "already ran — fade/short, not a long entry". Logic unchanged.
3. **Momentum Heat sort + ↑VWAP-reclaim badge + Appeared column (2026-06-10).**
   Default-sorts by composite `heat` (freshness+accel+VWAP-reclaim+5m-RVol+
   news) so fresh/rising names beat stale big-Chg% leaders. `first_seen_at`
   DB-seeded on boot. New `EnrichedRow` fields: `heat`, `vwap_reclaim`,
   `first_seen_at`.
4. **hype_score (2026-06-05)**, **burned-ticker ⛔ warnings (2026-06-04)**,
   **Outcomes/backtest tab (2026-06-02)**, **forward outcome tracking

## RESOLVED — Ignition recalibration (2026-06-12, code-complete, awaiting commit/deploy)

The operator chose **(d) dig deeper → then recalibrate runner_score**. Done.

**Where the edge concentrates** (22-day `screener_outcomes`, ignition):
- **The golden cohort**: fresh, *regular-hours* ignition up **25–100% intraday,
  no pre-market run** → **+14.9%/1d and HOLDS +14%/5d** (the only ignition slice
  that doesn't give back). The old score put it at avg ~45 (below the 58 line) —
  only 29% alerted, and the *non-alerting* ones outperformed the alerting ones.
  The score was inverted against its own best cohort.
- **PM-exhaustion**: the *same* 25–100% move that traded in PM did 0.0%/1d.
- **Catalyst TYPE, not impact**: FDA/clinical +14.6%/1d (holds 5d); dilution
  −8.3, partnership −5.0, M&A −3.4 — yet M&A/partnership were scored *bullish*
  and got positive points. High impact_score / urgency trended negative.
- **Day rel_volume** (25×+ → +4.4%/1d) predicts cleanly; the 35-pt Volume
  component keyed off `rel_vol_5min`, which is null/0 ~40% of the time.
- **Shelf penalty was inverted**: effective/active shelf names out-performed at
  1d (it's a multi-day kill-switch, not a same-session signal).

**Shipped (code-complete; typecheck + web build pass; NOT yet committed — operator
pushes via VPN):** rewrote `runner-score.ts` — Float(30) + Volume(30, max of
5-min & day-RVol ladders) + type-aware Catalyst(−15..+15) + Maturity(−25..+12,
rewards the 25–100% band) + Pre-market(−8..0) + Shelf(−5..0, active only).
Breakdown keys `earliness`/`halt` → `maturity`/`premarket`. Poller: new
`seenInPremarketToday` set (midnight-cleared), `scoreRunner` call passes
`catalyst_type` + `seen_in_premarket`, `alert_score` 58→**65**,
`alert_entry_chg_max` 40→**100**, alert bypass retied to premium catalyst
(`b.catalyst ≥ 8` = FDA/news-halt) instead of any bullish-strong/major. Web:
`RunnerScoreBreakdown` + two tooltips updated. Spec §3 rewritten.

**Validation (reconstructed new score on history):** alert set `≥65 ∨ premium
catalyst, cap 100` → **+13.9%/1d, +5.2%/5d, ~5/day** vs old `≥58, cap 40` →
+4.7%/1d, −0.4%/5d, ~8/day. Monotonic (58→+8.9, 65→+17.5, 70→+24.6). Win rate
stays ~45% — it's an **asymmetric positive-skew lottery** (median ~flat); the
recalibration concentrates the right-tail runners into the alert set and kills
the 5-day give-back. Matches the operator's "ride winners, cut losers" thesis.

**Watch after deploy:** new `screener_outcomes` rows for `screen='ignition'`
will accrue under the new score — let ≥5d mature before judging live, don't
retune off the first few days. The reconstruction used `first_change_pct` for
maturity (live uses current `change_pct` via the day's max-score cycle) — a
small in-sample/live gap to keep in mind. Queries used are in this session's
history (temp tables `ir_entry` / `scored`, joined `ignition_results` →
`screener_cycles` → `screener_outcomes`).

## Other deferred / known (refreshed 2026-08-04)

> Mostly about layers that are parked now. Current open items live in START HERE.

- **The grading pass** — the single next task; see THE PENDING TASK above
  (reclaim precision per tf, clean segment from 2026-07-28). Watch reclaim
  volume/day post-07-27 (junk-arming pends + no-stale-wait add fires on
  sparse names — dials: `SPARSE_5M_MIN_BARS_24H`, the coherence gate,
  `nominate_min_notional`).
- **Databento data-quality findings worth a support ticket:** (a) weekend
  test-session prints stream on live EQUS.MINI and appear in historical
  ohlcv (we filter both ends now); (b) PFSA ohlcv-1h interleaves two price
  scales ~25× apart for months (premarket/AH vs regular buckets); (c)
  single wildly off-scale poison prints (EDBL). All contained by our
  guards + Yahoo fallbacks, but the vendor should know.
- **⚠️ Droplet RESIZED 2 GB → 4 GB (2026-07-28, operator's call) after the
  swap-thrashing incident below; ~2 GB headroom at current load, sweep peaks
  ~1.3 GB RSS. The incident record (measured on the 2 GB box):** Symptom that led here: "dashboard stays empty for a
  while after reload". Measured mid-incident: Node **RSS 877 MB + 1.53 GB
  SWAPPED**, host 102 MB free, **80–90% iowait** during background sweeps —
  the request path itself was fine between bursts (p50 0.36s), so this
  presents as INTERMITTENT slowness, not steady slowness. Root cause was the
  1d refetch storm (fixed — see below); after the fix + restart: RSS 294 MB,
  swap 0, 1.1 GB available. **Watch RSS over days** — before the fix the
  process climbed to 2.4 GB in 10 hours. Boot alone replays ~1.6M persisted
  bars through the trackers (peak 436k rows in ONE array in
  `seedTrackerFromTable`), and there are 5 EMA layers + a 3.4k-symbol tick
  feed. If it creeps back into swap the levers are, in order: trim bar
  retention (bars_1d 260d / bars_4h 130d are the big ones), chunk the boot
  seed per symbol instead of one array per table, or resize 2→4 GB
  (~$12→$24/mo). Diagnose with `free -m`, `VmRSS`/`VmSwap` in
  `/proc/<node-pid>/status`, and `vmstat 1 3` (watch `si`/`wa`).
- **HTF freshness must scale with the bar interval (fixed 2026-07-28):** the
  backfill's "stale" test was a flat 12h for every layer, but a 1d bucket
  closes once per ET day and never across a weekend — so **all 1,507 daily
  series read stale permanently (min age 71h)** and every sweep refetched
  each one's 240d of ohlcv-1h (~40 min, ~350k upserts, metered Databento).
  Passes ran 60–100 min against an hourly timer = continuous load. Now
  `max(12h, 4 × interval)` (1d 96h, 4h 16h, 15m/1h unchanged): 1d stale
  1507 → 18. **If another coarse layer is ever added, check this rule
  first** — the same trap is waiting for it.
- **CI deploy flakiness (watch):** two incident classes on 07-25/27 — a
  Buildx-setup infra flake failing the whole run (rerun fixes), and
  deploys that succeed WITHOUT recreating the api container (image digest
  unchanged or compose no-op). After any deploy that matters, verify by
  grepping a code marker in the container's dist/, not by run status.
- **Dead-tape nominations stay (operator's call, 2026-07-24, the PBM case):**
  odd-lot-only trickles on consolidated-sparse names can nominate (cross +
  reclaim) with ⚠️ and can never confirm ($10k floor unreachable) — the
  operator reviewed the PBM anatomy (TV's tape silent 2h, our feed saw $1.1k
  of odd lots) and chose to keep the current floors. No `sib_median × price`
  nomination floor for now — if grading shows the dead-baseline band
  (sib_median×cross_price < ~$2k) is pure expire-noise, the calibrated
  conditional floor (dead baseline ⇒ escalated trigger notional) is the
  designed dial; meta carries everything needed to place the line.
- **TV links are exchange-qualified for Nasdaq names (2026-07-25, the SPRO
  collision):** TV resolved bare "SPRO" to CBOE's S&P 500 Buffer Protect
  INDEX instead of Spero Therapeutics — the operator's chart-verification
  loop landed on the wrong instrument. All TV chart links (11 Telegram
  formatter sites + 3 web sites via `tvChartUrl`) now prefix `NASDAQ:` for
  SEC-confirmed Nasdaq listings (`company_tickers_exchange.json`, daily,
  `tvSymbol()` in edgar.ts; web fetches `/api/screener/tv-map` lazily).
  NYSE deliberately stays bare — SEC lumps NYSE American/Arca under "NYSE"
  while TV files those under AMEX: (CPHI), so a blind prefix would break
  Arca links.
- **Weekend bars are exchange TEST prints — dropped at the gate
  (2026-07-25, a Saturday):** Databento streamed 132k live bars on a closed
  Saturday (exchanges run scheduled production tests; the prop feeds behind
  EQUS.MINI carry the test prints at plausible-but-fake prices). ROLR
  "printed" +9% and fired a phantom 4h reclaim; pendings and near-misses
  fired too, and test bars were being PERSISTED into bars_5m/1h/4h (would
  have poisoned Monday's seed replays). onBar now drops any bar whose ET
  day is Sat/Sun before every consumer; Saturday's leaked bars + the two
  phantom tier_events (VLN 5m, ROLR 4h reclaims) purged from prod.
- **Benzinga + Anthropic PARKED (2026-07-25, operator's call):** EMA
  layers are the primary instrument, so both tokens are COMMENTED OUT in
  the droplet .env — key presence IS the toggle (operator preferred one
  mechanism over separate _DISABLED flags; $147/mo Benzinga, Anthropic was
  already dead on exhausted credits).
  While parked: 📰 radar is fully DARK (the Benzinga delta is its only
  source — no radar rows, no radar grading, no radar tick-arming); news
  coverage = Finviz + Yahoo + SEC + halts (cross-row enrichment unaffected
  — its top-up is Finviz/Yahoo); classification stays rules-only. This
  consciously suspends the "compute always" principle for the radar layer
  to save the subscription. Re-enable: uncomment the token + `up -d api`.
- **Yahoo's unofficial API is now load-bearing** for thin-tape EMA warmups
  (5m sparse fallback + HTF consolidated fallback, hourly scans; since
  07-23 also the warm-but-sparse 5m/HTF re-seeds — the daily sparse sweep
  is ~hundreds of calls at 1.5s spacing, watch for throttling). If Yahoo
  breaks: MINI-quiet names lose warmup/freshness/level-correction
  (LICN/TMDE/CPHI classes return — though gap-decay alone now keeps sparse
  EMA horizons TV-like); everything else unaffected. Watch `viaYahoo` +
  `sparse done` counts in `[ema-backfill]` logs. The clean escape remains
  the Databento SIP/PLUS upgrade (or metered EQUS.PLUS historical polling).
- **Deploy-loss residuals (tracker memory):** 5m 'observing' rows drop on
  reseed (HTF rows survive their display windows); PENDING reclaims (thin
  window / junk-arming / decay-flip) are lost on deploy — re-fire needs the
  geometry to recur; detector quiet baselines rebuild ~1-2 min. All logged
  classes, all self-correcting.
- **Trade Journal attribution join (TJ)** — trades ↔ `screener_outcomes` +
  detections on `(ticker, et_date)`; the report-system payoff, untouched since
  06-21.
- ✅ **EMA warmup persistence — DONE 2026-07-15** (`bars_5m` table + boot
  replay): three 07-14 deploys had left the 📈 layer completely silent on
  07-15 (warmup restarted each time; thin names need ~a day of closed bars),
  which made the trial ungradable — so it got promoted from "if it graduates"
  to prerequisite. Live closed 5m bars persist (batched, 3-day retention,
  pruned at midnight); boot replays 48h through the tracker silently (no
  events from history; overlap-guarded). First boot after this deploy seeds
  from an empty table — persistence accumulates from then on, so the layer is
  warm across all subsequent deploys. **Grading note: treat 07-15 as a blind
  day; the 📈 trial effectively restarts 07-16.**
- **DB growth** — 4.9 GB total, ~20 GB/yr run-rate (per-cycle tables dominate);
  95 GB free after the resize (disk grew 67→116 GB) → years of headroom.
  Plan when disk crosses ~60%: archive+prune
  per-cycle rows >120–180d (or month-partitioning). Deliberately deferred.
- **Databento capacity** — flat $199/mo live (EQUS.MINI, ~3.4k symbols);
  historical is metered but tiny (daily ohlcv backfills bill cents; the
  hourly HTF scans are batched 100 syms/request). Real limit = ONE live
  connection (deploy-overlap incident class, fixed 06-22). Bar stores:
  bars_5m (**45d retention** since 07-30 — grading evidence, with OHLC;
  5d boot-seed window unchanged), bars_15m (12d), bars_1h (35d), bars_4h
  (130d), bars_1d (260d).
- **Known-runner set eviction** — `radarHistory` re-seeds per boot (rolling
  30d); a process running many weeks without deploys wouldn't evict. Moot at
  current deploy cadence; one-line daily reseed if that changes.
- **Tick catches still lack float/catalyst enrichment** (open item d from
  06-23) — note the cross layer got its news enrichment 07-22; the ladder
  did not.
- **Deeper Finviz relief** (share the AH v=152 overlay across screens) and
  **retune swing/dual-signal thresholds from outcomes** — both still open,
  both non-urgent.
- Git state at handover: `main` in sync with origin as of this 2026-07-27
  grooming commit; working tree clean apart from the operator's gitignored
  scratch files.
