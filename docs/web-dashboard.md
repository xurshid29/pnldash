# Momentum Screener — Web Dashboard

Status as of 2026-10-02. The bash scanner (`screener-poll_breakout.sh`) and the web dashboard are both functional; the bash version remains the reference implementation. The web port lives in `apps/api` + `apps/web` and runs in parallel without sharing state with it.

**Current operating profile — lean manual-playbook desk.** The active UI is
Momentum (with the A+…D grade, default sort) + Momentum History, plus the
Watchlist and Alerts tabs and opportunity alerts (phone + dashboard). Ignition, MOMO, SETUPS, EMA, Swing,
Outcomes, Faders/Continuation, Edge (since 2026-08-21), the ↑ VWAP reclaim
tick layer (since 2026-08-22) and Live Ticks itself (since 2026-10-01 — no
Databento connection; the left rail is gone and the Watchlist is a screener
tab next to Momentum and History) are
preserved but parked by the default
`COMPONENTS_DISABLED=ignition,momo,setups,ema,swing,outcomes,continuation,edge,vwap,ticks`.
When `edge` is parked, `EdgeService` never starts (no preset load, no 1m bar
persistence, no `edge_events`), `/api/edge` answers 503, and the web hides the
⚡ Edge tab and stops its 3s poll.
This is an end-to-end gate, not a cosmetic one: disabled screens stop their
Finviz calls, background jobs, technical-bar replay/backfills, persistence and
payload construction. With all three daily-bar consumers parked,
`DailyBarsService` does not start; the Databento feed starts in detector-only
mode so Live Ticks remains active. Set `COMPONENTS_DISABLED=` to restore the
full experimental desk, or remove individual slugs selectively (`faders` is an
accepted alias for `continuation`). `/health` and SSE cycle payloads expose the
effective component flags.

**Opportunity alerts (2026-10-01).** One server-side engine
(`services/opportunity-alerts.ts`) decides, every cycle, three kinds of alert
and sends the same set to Telegram and to the dashboard (`payload.alerts` →
sound + browser notification): 🅰️ the first time a Momentum ticker reaches A+
that day (new or upgraded), ⚡ a name on screen ≥5 min trading ≥+10% above
its price ~60s earlier with RVol 1m ≥1000% (15-min cooldown, folded into a
same-ticker alert from <5 min ago), and 📰 a headline published ≤30 min
before we first see it on a screened ticker (deduped by URL and by title;
the phone only gets catalyst ≥40). Sized on September 2026: ~63 phone
alerts/day, busiest hour 09:00–10:00 ET ≈10. Per-type switches sit next to
Alerts ON/OFF in the header; phone mutes are the `ALERTS_DISABLED` slugs
`grade_aplus`, `fast_move`, `news`. On screen (2026-10-02): an **Alerts**
tab (Momentum · History · Watchlist · Alerts) lists the day's log from
`GET /api/screener/alerts`, filterable by kind, with price/grade at the alert
and the live "since alert" move; Momentum rows that alerted in the last 15
min carry 🅰️/⚡/📰 badges next to the ticker, pulse for ~90s after the
alert and keep a colored left edge (A+ green, fast amber, news blue) for the
rest of the 15 min; and every new alert also opens an in-page toast (top
right, 12s, click = select ticker) that follows Alerts ON/OFF and the
per-type switches — it shows even when the OS swallows browser
notifications. Sizing study:
`scripts/research/momentum-grade/alert_study.py`.

**Momentum grade (2026-10-01).** Each Momentum row shows a letter A+ … D,
re-graded every cycle (2-minute smoothing) and used as the table's default
sort. It is a fitted ranking of the chance of a +10% move within 30 minutes
(Aug fit / Sep out-of-sample: A+ ≈27% → D ≈0.1%), built from change %, time
of day, catalyst, float, freshness and live tape activity. A+ is a two-way
market (−10% first slightly more often than +10%); it marks attention, not
direction. A fade cap downgrades an A-tier name to B+ (shown with a red ▼
and how far off it is) while it sits ≥8% below its 10-minute high — those
names turn down-first more often than up-first. Model + re-fit pipeline:
`services/momentum-grade.ts`,
`scripts/research/momentum-grade/`.

This pivot follows the operator's current 1-minute top-mover workflow: tune an
EMA pair per ticker, treat those EMAs and session VWAP as dynamic levels, and
enter only when price bounces/reclaims a level while MACD 3/15/8 turns upward,
using “breakout or bailout” for risk. The separate **⚡ Edge** surface is now
implemented: saved per-user ticker presets; feed-session VWAP; custom EMA
bounce/reclaim; standard EMA-MACD 3/15/8 line + histogram rise; and a
Warming/Watching/Armed/Entry/Bailout state machine. Armed is an intrabar early
warning; Entry and Bailout are completed-1m-bar transitions. Per-preset browser,
sound and Telegram switches ride a durable `edge_events` log. The service uses
the existing Databento stream and stores only saved tickers in `edge_bars_1m`,
so the parked global EMA/MACD machinery remains off.

**Pre-pivot snapshot (retained for restoration context)** — the screener had five tabs (`[Momentum] [Swing] [History] [Outcomes] [Faders]` — Momentum default-sorts by **Heat**; "Faders" is the demoted-and-reframed former Continuation tab, see 2026-06-11 note below), the Ignition sidebar stayed always-visible on the left, three Telegram alert paths fired (Momentum / Ignition / Swing / Continuation-dual-signal 🎯), and one cached view (Continuation) refreshed every ~10 min, seeding from **both** screens (`screener_results ∪ ignition_results`) and forward-tracking each name via `daily_bars`. Every Swing-spec step (1–6) and the Continuation/History/dual-signal additions remain in the repository.

**Strategy shift (2026-06-02) — read this before building.** The operator's current thinking, which should steer priorities: (1) **Continuation is weak as a *predictor*** — guessing whether a name continues up next session is closer to gambling than edge; keep the tab (zero-cost DB derivative) but don't treat "showed up N days" as a buy signal. (2) **The Momentum screen + catalyst is the higher-value play**: enter when a name *first appears* with a good bullish catalyst, ride it, and **exit when the larger pullback begins** (topping tails, MACD rolling, heavy red volume) — the exit is discretionary chart-reading the screener can only *assist*, not automate. (3) **Catalyst quality is the operator's stated #1 factor.** The **forward outcome tracking** instrument (shipped — see Recent additions + "Reading the outcome data") now exists precisely to *test* these claims with data rather than intuition; the gap going forward is letting it accrue ~2 weeks of go-forward depth, then retuning scores/alerts and possibly building an "exit-assist" + a small outcomes view. Caveat: do not act on the first backfill's numbers — samples are tiny.

See **Recent additions** for what shipped lately and **Remaining work** for what's next. The low-float runner-detection strategy + roadmap lives in [`catching-runners.md`](catching-runners.md); the Ignition screener design in [`ignition-screener-spec.md`](ignition-screener-spec.md); the multi-day Swing screener design in [`swing-screener-spec.md`](swing-screener-spec.md).

## Recent additions (since the 2026-05-04 snapshot)

- **Lean component parking + dashboard performance fix (2026-08-18).** Added the reversible `COMPONENTS_DISABLED` product gates and made the lean profile the default. The web exposes only Live Ticks, Momentum and Momentum History; Quote Details no longer refetches ticker history on every SSE `cycle_id`. Backend gates cover Ignition/Swing fetch+score+write paths, Outcome/Continuation jobs, DailyBarsService startup, and EMA/MACD seed/backfill/persistence. Live Ticks still runs through the same Databento sidecar and `TickDetector`. Production motivation: Node ~2.8–3.1 GB RSS + ~1.95 GB swap on a 4 GB host; Continuation's ~10-minute refresh materialized ~1.31M daily-bar rows for ~888 tickers and correlated with 39–65s poll stalls (up to ~101s). No migrations and no historical-data deletion.

- **↗ EMA price-reclaim layer — the operator's primary instrument (arc 2026-07-10 → 08-03; TRIAL, semantics frozen, checkpoint ~2026-08-12).** Since 08-01 the dashboard's default view is the ↗ EMA tab with A+/A/B attention tiers (HTF co-confirm ±2min; A+ measured 32.3% reach +20% same-day vs B ≈ the random-bar null), and the measured entry playbook is select-on-chips → wait for the pullback (comes 81% of the time) → enter its break → structural stop → exit into strength. Grew out of the twice-measured-at-chance EMA/MACD studies as "the cross NOMINATES, volume CONFIRMS": first as the 📈 EMA 6/50→10/65 crossover on 5m (07-10), then intrabar TV-parity (07-16), 1h/4h layers (07-17/21), news-enriched rows + EMA-only alert posture (07-22), gap-decay TV-parity EMA horizons on the sparse MINI tape + pend-through-thin-evidence + Yahoo consolidated re-seeds (07-23, the CPHI fix), the ↗ price-reclaim channel (TV's "price Crossing Up EMA10 AND EMA65" pair) as a parallel A/B (07-24), and finally **reclaim-only on FIVE timeframes** (5m/15m/1h/4h/1d) after the operator retired the crossover by instinct (07-26; `cross_detect` kill switch keeps the machinery for a data revisit). The 07-27 shakedown hardened it live: basis-break guard for reverse splits (calibrated to spare genuine doublers), weekend test-print gates on the live feed AND historical backfills, corrupt-source guards (mixed-scale/poison-print series → Yahoo fallback), no stale wait on reclaim intrabar, and junk prints can pend but never disarm the arming. Telegram: 5m reclaim confirms only (`ema_reclaim` slug); HTF layers dashboard+grading. **07-28 (the FIEE miss) closed three warmup holes that had made the 5m layer structurally blind to trickle tapes** — the below-warmup backfill discarded its own history for any symbol already streaming live bars, the Yahoo fetch window was a calendar range where warmup is a bar count (FIEE's whole consolidated week was 86 bars vs 65 needed), and gap-decay was compounding phantom steps onto *consolidated* replay history, dragging EMA65 below the price so the channel never armed — plus **staged arming**, so a curl that clears the fast EMA first and the slow one bars later still fires (TV alerts the two crossings independently; FIEE staged them 20 minutes apart). **The full mechanism reference lives in `docs/detection-layers.md`; the dated engineering log in `docs/HANDOVER.md`.** Grading: `tier_events` tier='cross' meta.signal='reclaim', clean segment from 2026-07-29, reclaim precision per timeframe, segmented on `staged_bars`.

- **Paid news APIs parked (2026-07-25, operator's call).** Benzinga ($147/mo) + Anthropic tokens commented out in the droplet .env — key presence is the toggle. While parked: 📰 radar dark, catalyst classification rules-only, news = Finviz/Yahoo/SEC/halts. The EMA reclaim layer is the primary instrument and doesn't depend on either.

- **🤫 Quiet-accumulation tier (2026-07-05).** The earliest state in the LIVE TICKS ladder (accum → 👀 watch → 🛰️ confirmed): a name arriving on a screen still quiet on price (chg 0–10%) but with strong early volume (fast RVol ≥ 10× within its first 10 minutes on screen) flags as a teal 🤫 row with the quietest ping in the set. Measured on a 55-day cohort before building: quiet+volume names put in a ≥+20pt move 20–25% of the time in AH / 12–14% in PM-REG vs ~3% for quiet names without volume — a 3–7× lift; USDE (2026-07-01: +6.97% / 21× day-RVol at 16:04 ET, launch at 17:48, news only the next morning) is the motivating case, and the reduction of the operator's "EMA cross + rising MACD on flat candles" chart observation to the measurable state that carries it. Entries promote to 👀 when the tick detector's watch fires (suppression skipped — the tier already vetted them) or via a display-only screen backstop at +10%, confirm via the normal surge/sustain paths, and expire after 120 min with a graded log line (`grep accum` → flag / promote / expire-with-peak) for live precision tuning. Telegram 🤫 fires only for the violent tail (fastRV ≥ 3000%) or accumulation with a bullish catalyst riding along, once per ticker/day. Knobs: `ACCUM` const in poller.ts. Study SQL: `apps/api/scripts/research/quiet-accum-cohort-*.sql`.
- **📰 NEWS RADAR — catalyst-first detection (2026-07-03).** Operator: "news comes in, and 10–15 min later the ticker starts moving — can we catch that window?" Measured on 30d of ignition detections: when a headline precedes a detection, the median news→detection lag is **7.9 min** (p25 2 min, p75 91 min) — the observation is real. New third detection layer, *earlier* than both existing ones: **news radar (pre-move) → tick feed (move starting) → screens (move confirmed)**. The market-wide Benzinga delta the poller already pulls every 20s (now **paginated ×3** — a burst >100 articles/cycle used to silently drop past the watermark) is matched against the **known-runner set** (every momentum/ignition ticker from the last 30d, DB-seeded + live-grown) for names NOT currently on any screen; fresh Nasdaq halts ride the same path (a T1 on a known runner is the loudest pre-move signal). Hits are rules-classified immediately (same URL cache → the async LLM refinement upgrades scores in place; an LLM bearish flip drops the entry), bearish skipped, and surface in a purple **📰 NEWS RADAR** sidebar section (impact/hype/type badges + headline + age, capped 12) with a soft dashboard ping. **Escalation:** the radar **arms the tick feed** (TickFeedService subscribes radar tickers within ~30s, prior close from `daily_bars`) so the watch/confirm machine is listening before the move; when the tick detector or a screen later picks the name up, the entry flips to a green **moving ↗**. TTL 90 min (the lag p75); expiry logs `expired (moved)` vs `expired (no move)` — **the precision study reads these logs** (`grep news-radar`), since the DB can't answer how many headlines lead nowhere. Telegram 📰 only for strong/major non-bearish (once/ticker/day; dashboard shows everything). Radar sleeps while session='closed'. Knobs: `NEWS_RADAR` in poller.ts (history_days 30, ttl_min 90, max_display 12).
- **Tick feed two-tier: 👀 WATCH → 🛰️ CONFIRMED (2026-07-02).** A week of prod near-miss diagnostics proved the single-shot detector was structurally late on nano-caps: catches fired at +23–63% because (a) names first seen already moving have **no quiet baseline** and could never fire (LHAI +238%, EHGO +120% — the biggest movers), (b) the relvol≥5× gate clears 20–30 chg-points after the price gate (DSY near-missed +23% at 1.8×, fired +56.7%), (c) slow grinders never trip mom≥8%/60s. `TickDetector` is now a state machine: **WATCH** = price-led flag (cum ≥10%, ≤100%, near-high, junk floor = ≥5 prints & ≥$2k feed-visible notional/2min — rejects the "+15% on 5 shares" prints), no baseline needed; **CONFIRM** = the unchanged validated surge rule (strict superset of the old detector), OR a baseline-free *sustain* read (age ≥2min + extended ≥3pts beyond the flag + holding ≥ flag price + ≥$25k since flag) for gappers, OR a Finviz screen returning the name (screen relvol gates = the volume evidence the watch was waiting for); **FADE** = 15-min TTL or ≥60% giveback of the flag move (faded names can still surge-confirm later). Offline regression: previously-uncatchable gappers INHD/SUNE/CIIT/PPCB now all confirm via sustain, watch flags land 17–114s before Finviz at materially lower chg%, false-confirm rate on the 38-fizzler control *improved* to 3% (1/38), fizzler watches fade on their own (3/4). **Alerts are tiered** (operator call): watch → Telegram 👀 + soft dashboard ping; confirm → Telegram 🛰️ + radar ping; both once/ticker/ET-day per tier, so a real runner = exactly two pings. Watches on names already screening are suppressed ONLY when the cross is stale (`fresh_cross=false` — first sight already above the line: deploy-boot seeds, mid-move subscribes); an observed live cross alerts even on-screen, because a non-catalyst screen row generates no push of its own (the AUID fix, same day) — and for those, pre-existing screen presence doesn't count as confirmation (`screened_at_watch` gates the screen-promotion path). Sidebar LIVE TICKS rows are styled by status (amber watch / blue confirmed / grey faded linger), confirmed rows show `⚑ +N%` = where the flag was planted (the visible lead). Also: **screen-row fast-subscribe** — `TickFeedService.syncScreenRows()` (30s) subscribes current momentum/ignition rows immediately with prior closes derived from the rows themselves (skipped in AH where change/price anchor to today's close), instead of waiting for the 10-min universe refresh that produced "0 quiet" blindness. Calibration knobs in `TICK_DETECT` (note: $ knobs are EQUS.MINI *feed-visible* dollars, a fraction of consolidated tape — recalibrate from the watch/confirm/fade transition logs, `grep "\[tickfeed\]"`).
- **Trade Journal — IBKR import + Tradervue-style P&L calendar 📅 (2026-06-21).** The first piece of the trade-journal / "did the screener predict my actual trades?" report system. A new **top-level `/journal` page** (own route + a Dashboard|Journal switch in the header; the Charts/Alerts controls hide off the dashboard) with a month P&L calendar that mirrors Tradervue: each ET-day cell shows realized net (or gross — toggle) tinted green/red + trade count, a weekly-total column, a monthly total, and a month summary strip (trades / win-rate / winners-losers / commission). Clicking a day opens its round-trip drill-down. **Import** is a drag-drop of an IBKR **TradeLog `.tlg`** (Reports → Statements → Third-Party Downloads → TradeLog) — parsed server-side, deduped, and idempotent on re-upload. **Data model:** `broker_imports` (file metadata + sha256) + `trade_executions` (one row per fill, `UNIQUE(user_id, exec_id)` so re-importing an overlapping range skips duplicates). Round-trip **trades are derived in code** (`services/ibkr-tlg.ts` `matchTrades`), never stored — a *trade* is a flat-to-flat round trip per symbol, P&L = `−Σamount` (`+Σcommission` for net), attributed to the **exit date** (so an overnight hold lands on the day it closed). **Validated against the operator's own Tradervue: gross daily P&L matches to the penny on all 8 days of the sample (gross $327.88 / net $233.19 for the month), and an integration test against Postgres confirms import/dedup/calendar/drill-down end-to-end.** Routes: `POST /api/trades/import`, `GET /api/trades/calendar?from&to`, `GET /api/trades/day?date`, `GET /api/trades/imports`, `DELETE /api/trades/imports/:id`. Per-user (JWT). Global `express.json` limit raised 100kb→5mb for statement uploads. **Next (the payoff, deferred):** join `trade_executions`/derived trades to `screener_outcomes` + detections on `(ticker, et_date)` — per-trade screener attribution (did I trade what it flagged? enter near detection or chase? which catalyst types/score bands did I actually profit on?). Known nuance: one overnight trade's *count* differs from Tradervue by 1 (Tradervue also tallies it on the open day); P&L is unaffected.
- **Alert channels rebalanced: dashboard for early, Telegram for high-conviction (2026-06-17).** Operator feedback: Telegram fired too often to be a useful "catch it early" tool — push is the wrong channel for a high-frequency discovery signal. So the early/high-frequency signals moved to the **dashboard** (glanceable, scanned) and Telegram is reserved for the rare high-conviction pushes. Specifically: (1) tick-feed catches now surface as a pinned **🛰️ LIVE TICKS** section at the top of the Ignition sidebar (`payload.tick_catches` — ticker · price · chg% · rel-vol · "Xs ago" · Finviz/TV links, clickable to chart), dropping out once a screen catches the name up or after a 15-min TTL; **no Telegram for tick catches**. (2) The **fresh-burst 🚀 and new-ignition 🆕 Telegram pushes are silenced** (functions kept dormant, `pushFreshBurstAlerts`/`pushNewIgnitionAlerts` calls removed) — those names are already visible in the Ignition sidebar with the NEW highlight + score. (3) **Telegram still fires for high-conviction only:** ≥65 ignition ⚡, fresh strong/major catalyst 🚨, dual-signal 🎯, swing 📊. Net: you watch the dashboard for early movers; Telegram only interrupts you for the ones worth it.
- **Live tick-feed early-ignition detector 🛰️ (2026-06-17, LIVE in prod).** A "first detector" that runs ahead of the 20s Finviz poll on a Databento EQUS.MINI per-second trade feed, to catch an ignition START 30–90s before the screener surfaces it. **Activated + validated live** (Databento Standard/US-Equities $199/mo flat, $0 metered; first prod win **MNTS caught 20 min before momentum**); catches surface in the **🛰️ LIVE TICKS** dashboard section, not Telegram (see the "Alert channels rebalanced" entry above). Build/validation detail follows. **Validated offline first** ($0 on Databento free credit): a RELATIVE-volume surge (not absolute $) separates real ignitions (9.8–100× the symbol's own quiet baseline) from fading blips (0.3–0.7×); on the validation set it caught the ramping runners 15–90s before Finviz at far lower chg (DSY +24% vs +29, GLXG +28% vs +56, BYAH +60% 90s early), skipped the gappers (INHD/RGNT — uncatchable by any feed), and false-fired on only 1–2/38 fizzlers (3–5%). **Architecture:** `tick-detect.ts` (pure causal `TickDetector` — rel-vol≥5× + cum≥12% + mom≥8%/60s + near-high; the min-SHARES floor, not a sample count, is the guard since these nano-caps have ~1 quiet pre-surge print) → `TickFeedService` spawns a Python sidecar (`sidecar/tickfeed.py`, the official `databento` live client — no Node client exists for the DBN-over-TCP feed) that forwards JSON bars → detector → `poller.onTickCandidate` fires a 🛰️ alert, mutually exclusive with the ≥65 / fresh-burst / new-ignition paths. Watched symbol set = the structural universe (already low-float), prior closes derived from the same v=110 fetch (no extra Finviz calls). **All gated by `TICKFEED_ENABLED` (default off) — prod behavior unchanged until activated.** The TS detector is pinned by `scripts/verify-tick-detect.ts` (reproduces the validation), the sidecar's databento 0.80 field names + Live API were verified, and the api image (now Debian-slim + Python) builds clean. **Go-live: done** (subscription + flag + smoke-test all complete 2026-06-17). The honest ceiling: it recovers Finviz's ~30–90s screener lag on *ramping* runners but cannot catch *gappers* (the biggest movers gap with no intervening prints). See the [[tick-feed-scoping]] memory.
- **Ignition state restart-seeding + 🆕 new-ignition alert; two removals (2026-06-16).** Three operator-requested changes. **(1) Ignition cross-cycle state now restart-safe.** `ignitionFirstSeen` (drives the sidebar "New" section + `is_new`) and the alert-dedup sets were in-memory only, so every deploy flashed the *entire* ignition list as "new" and could re-blast Telegram alerts. New `seedIgnitionState()` on boot (mirrors `seedFirstSeen`/`seedVwapState`) rebuilds per-ticker first-seen from today's `ignition_results`, marks already-seen tickers so they don't re-fire the new-ignition heads-up, and marks ≥65-peak tickers as already-alerted (a name that hasn't crossed 65 yet can still alert post-deploy). The list now persists across deploys exactly as it was. **(2) New 🆕 "new ignition" Telegram alert.** The ≥65 alert fires hours late (fresh names score 15–30 — float/volume aren't populated on a ticker's first cycles) and the 🚀 fresh-burst alert only covers nano-floats (≤5M); this fills the middle — a *recently-appeared* ignition (within 15 min of first sight) that has built into the **40–64** band, chg 10–100%, non-bearish, deduped once/ticker/day, and skipping anything already 🚀'd or ≥65'd. Catches the 5–25M movers early. Measured ~6–8/day; dial = `NEW_IGNITION.alert_score`. **(3) Removed two unused surfaces:** the **Universe News** tab (News panel now shows Screener News only — Benzinga's value is microcap catalysts on screened names, not the off-universe firehose) and its `/api/news/feed?universe=true` path; and the **Ignition sub-tab** in Quote Details + its `GET /api/screener/ignition-history` endpoint and per-cycle DB query.
- **Ignition float cap raised 15→25M (2026-06-15).** Triggered by CAST (16.5M float → +364%) being categorically excluded from ignition while showing only on momentum with no fast alert path. A 10-day study across the momentum universe (which spans float to 50M) found the 15M cliff was arbitrary: the **15–25M band runs as hard as the 2–5M cohort and *harder* than the 10–15M band already included** — 34% reach +40% / 17% reach +100% / median peak +28%, vs 10–15M's 14% / 5% / +16%. Past 25M the edge falls off (25–50M: 12% reach +40%), so 25M is the ceiling, not higher. Change is a pair: `IGNITION.float_max_m 15→25` **and** the runner-score float ladder extended (`<25M → 6` pts, kept below the 10–15M band's 8 to stay monotonic on a small sample) — without the score change, raised names would enter the screen but score 0 on float and never reach the 65 alert line. Adds ~4.7 ignition-eligible names/day (price<$10, relVol>2). Float stays post-filtered in code (Finviz drops null-float rows if it's in the query string). **Watch:** grade the new 15–25M band against `screener_outcomes` once it matures — the 82-detection study was a momentum-screen proxy; the volume-led ignition population differs. (The fresh-burst 🚀 alert stays ≤5M — its nano-float validation doesn't transfer; extending it is a separate, to-be-validated question.)
- **Swing score v2 — "early volatile breakout" (2026-06-13) — outcome-validated rebuild.** The operator's review: swing results were "already too extended, around resistance" and not volatile enough to move 40–50% in days; he wanted breakouts *starting* from consolidation or downtrend reversal. The outcome data (508 detections, full 5d horizon) proved the old score **inverted**: the ≥65 alert set had the *lowest* forward upside (peak_5d +2.8 vs +8.4 for sub-50!); Trend 25 (mature SMA alignment) peaked +5.6 vs +9.5 for the disqualified below-SMA50 reversal class; the at-52w-high "Strength" reward selected the worst band; the 5-day tight-base flag mostly proxied low volatility (base+breakout combo did worst, +4.2); and ATR — the strongest upside predictor (≥8% ATR: 15% reach +20, 5% reach +40; <3%: zero) — wasn't scored at all. **v2 components:** Volatility 25 (ATR%, the IVT-killer), Room 15 (inverted 52w-high distance — depth is room), Trigger 30 (day-1 **fresh** cross of the prior 15-bar high = 20, day-2 = 12, *stale crosses no longer flag* — the old `broke_out` stayed true all the way up a parabola; + 15-bar base ≤15% = 6; + close strength 4), Volume 15 (unchanged), Trend 10 (nudge, not a gate — reversals can alert), Catalyst 10 (halved), Extension −15..0 (≥15/≥30% above 20-SMA), Shelf unchanged. **Validated by reconstruction from `daily_bars`: v2 ≥60 → peak_5d +12.1, 17% ≥+20, 7% ≥+40, ~3.5 det/day vs old ≥65's +2.8/0%/0%; day-1 crosses +14.4 peak with −11 dd vs +7.7/−18 stale.** Alert: score ≥**60** + day-1/2 fresh cross (or fresh bullish strong/major catalyst). Breakdown keys changed (`volatility/room/trigger/volume/trend/catalyst/extension/shelf`) — jsonb, no migration; flags keep their column names with new semantics (`broke_out`=day-1 cross, `broke_out_5d`=day-2). UI: score tooltip + flag strip relabeled (↑D1/↑D2). Note: mean chg_5d is negative in every bucket — the score targets *peak capture* (exit into strength), not passive holds. Spec §3/§3.1/§7/§11 updated. **Watch:** new-score `swing_results`/outcomes accrue from 2026-06-13 — old/new score values are not comparable across that date.
- **Heat persistence + a validated negative result (2026-06-12).** The operator observed the 1m+5m RVol pair reading better than Heat. Diagnosis: mid-day (freshness 0, reclaims rare) Heat degenerates into a coarse echo of the RVol columns — true, but a proposed pair-aware redesign of the RVol component was **tested against the 8-day replay and rejected**: the re-anchored ladder + burst bonus is already cleanly monotone (19.4 → 32.8 → 43.6 → 47.7 → 57.5 → 66.9% P(+4pts/10min) across tiers) and the redesign's merged mid-tiers scored *worse*. Notably the "dead-burst penalty" idea (1m < 0.2× 5m, the CAST case) does NOT hold at the hot tier — those rows still bounce 45.5% within 10 min vs 30.7% base, so don't penalize them on a 10-min horizon; whether they're bad *trades* is an outcomes question. Action taken instead: **persist `heat`, `vwap`, `above_vwap`, `vwap_reclaim` on every momentum row** (migration `20260612190000`) — heat was broadcast-only and the VWAP side was in-memory-only/unrecoverable, which made grading the untuned weights (freshness 30 / accel 25 / reclaim 25 / news 10) impossible. After ~2 weeks of go-forward depth, grade them against `screener_outcomes` like the ignition recalibration did. Division of labor stands: **Heat = the sort** (its freshness term surfaces sub-15-min names while RVol is still cold-starting), **the 1m/5m pair = the decision signal** on established names.
- **VWAP restart-seeding (2026-06-12) — the VWAP audit.** Reviewed the anchored-VWAP computation on request. The incremental math (Σ Δvol×price / Σ Δvol per 20s cycle, negative-correction guard, midnight-ET reset, sessions share the day anchor) is correct — a day-anchored reconstruction of UBXG from stored cycles gave 8.06 vs TradingView's session VWAP 8.24 (~2%, explained by 20s sampling + anchor start). Two real findings: **(1) restarts re-anchored every VWAP** — `vwapState` was memory-only (unlike the DB-seeded `firstSeenAt`), so after 2026-06-12's three deploys UBXG's live VWAP read 7.36 vs the true 8.06 and price sat on the **wrong side of the ▲/▼ flag** (also corrupting Heat's +8 above-VWAP / +25 reclaim). Fixed: `seedVwapState()` on boot rebuilds `cumPxVol`/`cumVol`/`lastVolume` per ticker from today's persisted `screener_results` (exact for Momentum-screened names; ignition-only names cold-start — `ignition_results` stores no volume), and seeds `prevAboveVwap` so a genuine reclaim on the first live cycle still registers. **(2) The "matches a chart Session VWAP" doc claim was overstated** — the anchor is *first on-screen sight*, so a name sighted mid-move gets an anchored-at-detection VWAP (pre-sight volume is unknowable from screen exports); comments corrected (including a stale "session-boundary reset" note — the reset is midnight-only).
- **Sell-side burst tint on RVol 1m (2026-06-12).** RVol is share turnover — direction-blind by construction (Finviz gives cumulative volume only, no buy/sell tape). New broadcast-only field `chg_delta_1min` (change% now vs ~1 min ago, from a small rolling `chgHistory` map beside `volHistory`); the Momentum RVol 1m cell tints **red** when the burst is hot (≥1000%) and price fell ≥2pts over the same minute — distribution/shakeout prints at a glance (the UBXG case). Measured before building: in the burst quadrant, *falling* bursts still bounce +4pts within 10 min **67.7%** of the time (vs 65.0% rising, 46.4% flat) — so the tint means "violent two-way decision moment", not "avoid", and Heat's direction-blind volume tiers stay as-is (gating them on direction would discard signal).
- **Fresh-burst Telegram alert 🚀 + 1-min RVol cold start (2026-06-12, same session as the RVol study).** The operator's pain: a new ticker appears already rallying, and by the time the RVol columns populate and a human reacts it's +50–60%. Diagnosis (prod forensics on the DSY case + today's runners): **(a)** the move starts *before* Finviz's screens return the name — DSY ramped +10% → +47% pre-sight, and half of today's runners first appeared already +45–95%; **(b)** Ignition sees these names 40s–2.6min earlier and less extended than Momentum (no change% gate); **(c)** Finviz's day `rel_volume` is useless in premarket (DSY printed 0.14–1.05× through its entire vertical — PM volume is tiny vs a full average day), so any day-RVol-gated rule structurally misses PM ramps; **(d)** the recalibrated ignition alert can't fire fast here — the volume component needs a 5-min read and PM names eat the −8 exhaustion penalty (DSY topped at score 64 < 65 while ripping +47→+134%). Fixes: **1-min RVol cold-start extrapolation** (measurable on a ticker's *second* cycle, ~20s, vs ~60s before; the 5-min cold start stays at ~75s), and a new **`pushFreshBurstAlerts`** path over the enriched *union*: first 3 min after first sight today (restart-safe via DB-seeded `firstSeenAt`), float ≤ 5M, chg 10–80%, `max(rel_vol_1min, rel_vol_5min) ≥ 8000%` (or instant day-RVol ≥ 30× outside PM), bearish-catalyst skip, once per ticker per ET day, premarket+regular only (AH alerts read hours later are noise). Over-cap rows skip *without* dedup so a pullback under +80 within the window still alerts. **Validated on a 7-day union replay: ~12.7 alerts/day (≈10 PM + 3 REG), median chg@alert +33%, median +13 pts further within 30 min (p75 +48), 47% ≥ +15 pts; would have caught DSY (alert ~98s after first sight, +77 pts of upside followed), CUPR (+76), ASBP (+39).** Live latency should beat the sim by ~40–60s thanks to the 1-min cold start. Knobs in the `FRESH_BURST` const (`poller.ts`) — to trade volume for conviction raise `rvol_fast_min`, but 15000 already loses DSY (first read 11231).
- **RVol study + 1-min RVol + Heat ladder re-anchor (2026-06-12) — the Momentum review.** An 8-day offline replay of prod `screener_results` (965k per-cycle rows; exact simulation of the poller's `volHistory` algorithm, validated at median ratio 0.995 vs stored values) found three things. **(1) The "5-min" RVol was a ~10-min window**: the anchor scan took the *oldest* retained sample (`h.find()` on an oldest-first array trimmed at 600s) without dt-rescaling, so once a name was tracked >5 min the window drifted to the 600s cap — measured median **2.04× inflated** (IQR 1.47–2.91). Fixed: youngest sample ≥ window, scaled by `window/dt`. **All `screener_results`/`ignition_results` rows before 2026-06-12 carry the inflated scale — segment cross-date tuning queries.** The ignition runner-score's 5-min volume tiers were halved (3000/1000/500/200 → 1500/500/250/100) to preserve the 2026-06-12 recalibration on the corrected metric. **(2) A 1-min RVol is real signal, not noise**: Finviz cumulative volume updates on ~88% of 20s polls for active names; at matched alert rates a true 1-min read detects 43% of imminent surges (+6 pts in 5 min) vs 28% for the old algorithm, equal ~57% precision; and the two windows are *independent* — P(+4 pts in 10 min) = 59.5% when both 1m & 5m are ≥ their p80 vs ~43% either alone vs 30.7% base. Shipped as `rel_vol_1min` end-to-end (enrich → SSE → persisted to both results tables → "RVol 1m" Momentum column + Quote Details stats/history + Telegram ignition/dual-signal alert meta). It's deliberately a *column/heat input, not an alert*: it flickers (67% still ≥p90 a minute later vs 91% for 5m). **(3) Heat's RVol ladder was saturated**: 80% of regular-session rows cleared the ≥300 tier and 45% cleared the top ≥2000 tier, so the component awarded near-constant points. Re-anchored to the fixed scale at measured percentiles (≥800→+4, ≥3000→+8, ≥9000→+14, ≥30000→+20 ≈ p57/p73/p85/p93) plus a **+6 "burst live" bonus** when 1m ≥ 4000 **and** 5m ≥ 5000 (both ≈p80 — the 59.5% quadrant). Also measured for later: volume *level* beats the derivative (sustained 5m-hot names outperform sudden bursts), and a collapsing 1-min on a hot name (t1/t5 < 0.5 → 35.8% vs 47.8%) is a drying-up/exit tell — a candidate exit-assist input. Analysis scripts ran off `data/momentum_series_8d.csv` (untracked).
- **Continuation demoted + reframed as "Faders" (2026-06-11) — outcome-validated.** Reviewed the Continuation list against `screener_outcomes` (2225 rows, full 5d horizon). The continuation pattern (a ticker seen on a prior ET day in the window) is a **negative long signal**: avg **−2.4% / 28% win over the next 5 days vs +3.2% / 39% for fresh first-day names**, and worse at extended entries (−3.8% / −25% drawdown at entry≥20%). The premise — multi-day names keep going up — does not hold in our data; these are fade/short candidates, not long entries. This confirms the 2026-06-02 "continuation is weak/gambling" call with numbers. Action: moved the tab from prime (2nd) position to **last**, relabeled **Continuation → "Faders"**, added a warning banner with the actual stats ("Already ran — not a long entry … watch for the fade/short"). The builder/`continuation.ts`/data are unchanged (still feed the dual-signal alert); this is a framing change. **The actionable flip side:** the edge is in FRESH first-day names — reinforcing the Momentum + Heat-sort + first-appearance direction.
- **Momentum Heat sort + ↑VWAP-reclaim badge (2026-06-10).** Momentum now default-sorts by a composite **Heat** score (0..100: freshness + acceleration + VWAP reclaim + above-VWAP + 5m-RVol + fresh-news) so fresh/rising names surface above stale big-Chg% leaders; Chg% stays one click away. A green **↑VWAP** badge flags the cycle a name reclaims VWAP (below→above). Plus an **Appeared** column (first-seen-today, UTC+5, with "Xh ago" staleness cue; DB-seeded on boot so it survives deploys). New `EnrichedRow` fields: `heat`, `vwap_reclaim`, `first_seen_at`. Column order: Ticker · Heat · Chg% · … · Appeared.

- **hype_score — a pump-potential axis orthogonal to catalyst quality (2026-06-05).** The STI case (06-04→05, +700%) exposed a real flaw: `impact_score` is *defined* as "likelihood the headline attracts intraday volume," yet the prompt instructs Claude to score buzzword PR LOW — and for nano-floats those are opposites (hype IS the catalyst). STI's "space-based AI battery for LEO data centers / lunar economy" PR correctly scored impact 16 (no counterparty/$/contract — substanceless promo) but ran 700%. Rather than corrupt impact_score, added a **second 0..100 axis, `hype_score`** = crowd/pump potential, scored *independently*: buzzword density (AI / space / LEO / quantum / crypto / nuclear / data-center / robotics / EV / biotech / GLP-1…) × nano-float / sub-$1 / microcap context. Low quality + high hype = "pump candidate: catch the spike, don't hold." Both classifiers compute it (Claude via an append-only, cache-stable prompt section + zod field; rules via `HYPE_RE` × float/mcap amplifiers), plumbed end-to-end (migration `news_classifications.hype_score` nullable, both poller inserts, classify-article, ticker-news, `GET /api/news`, `CatalystInfo` api+web). UI: `🚀 N` in the catalyst-modal verdict, and a **🚀 row marker** (`CatalystBadge`, shown *independently* of the score gate when hype≥60 & quality<50) on Momentum/Ignition/Swing. **Verified on prod:** re-classifying STI's LEO article → impact 16 / **hype 95**, reason "Pure buzzword stack… nano-float 2.47M, 1567x rel-vol screams pump dynamics." Tuning: `HYPE_RE` + amplifiers in `catalyst-rules.ts`; the prompt section in `catalyst-claude.ts`; the 🚀 thresholds (`HYPE_HIGH=60`, `QUALITY_LOW=50`) in `CatalystBadge.tsx`.

- **Burned-ticker warnings (2026-06-04) — ⛔ avoid markers.** Flags pump-and-dump names (VIVK: hot $108M crude-deal news → ripped ~$2.60 → dumped ~$0.93) with a ⛔ badge + dimmed row everywhere they appear (Momentum / Ignition / Continuation / Swing / Quote Details). **Two complementary sources:** (1) **MANUAL** — a per-user permanent avoid-list (`user_flagged_tickers`, no expiry — a burned name is a *structural* fact: promoter/float/vehicle persist and recur). Toggle from the Quote Details header (⛔ flag). `/api/prefs/flagged` GET/POST/DELETE. (2) **AUTO** — pump-and-dump offenders computed from `screener_outcomes`: an "event" = `peak_5d >= 40 AND chg_5d <= -15` with `bars_forward >= 3`; ≥1 event = burned. Global, cached 5 min. `GET /api/screener/burned-tickers`. `useTickerWarnings` merges both → `warning(ticker)` + `isFlagged/toggleFlag`; `WarningBadge` + `useIsWarned` are the shared primitives. **Design nuance (important):** the auto side is *evidence-based, so it lags* — it requires ≥3 forward daily bars, so a name that dumps **today** (like VIVK on detection day, `bars_forward=0`) auto-flags ~3 trading days later once the outcome confirms. That's exactly what the manual flag is for: instant judgment now vs. confirmed-history later. Verified on prod: auto list returned 10 real offenders (CDT +204%→−27%, YMAT, RYOJ, CODX…); manual flag round-trips.
- **Forward outcome tracking (2026-06-02) — the measurement instrument.** The first "tuning from data" piece. Until now the screeners made claims (runner-score 58, bullish catalyst) with no record of whether they were right; tuning was intuition + a few case studies. This records what *actually happened* after every detection so "did the score/catalyst/shelf predict the move?" becomes one SQL query instead of a debate.
  - **What:** new `screener_outcomes` table — one row per `(screen, ticker, et_date)` across **all three screens** (momentum / ignition / swing). Stores the **entry context** at detection (`entry_score`, `first_change_pct`, `peak_change_pct`, catalyst score/direction/urgency/type, `shelf_level`, `sessions`) and the **forward result** off `daily_bars`: `chg_1d/3d/5d`, `peak_5d` (best case), `drawdown_5d` (worst case), `bars_forward` (completeness). Anchor = the **detection-day close** (the honest overnight/multi-day-hold reference); intraday `first/peak_change_pct` kept so "already-extended entries fade" is testable.
  - **How:** `services/outcomes.ts` `computeOutcomes()` runs once/ET day from the poller's post-close window (16:30 ET; `lastOutcomesDate` guard, reset at midnight), fire-and-forget. **Idempotent upsert that revisits each row until `bars_forward >= 5`** — a name detected today gets `chg_1d` tomorrow, `chg_3d` in 3 days, `chg_5d` in 5. A boot-time catch-up (`index.ts`, +60s after start) backfilled the existing ~2 weeks. **Zero new live API calls:** reads `daily_bars`, and `dailyBars.trackUniverse()`s detected tickers so sub-$1 nano-caps that never entered the Swing universe get backfilled (their outcomes populate once bars land). Catalyst direction/urgency/type come from the `news_classifications` join (momentum rows carry no catalyst column; only `impact_score` lives on ignition/swing rows) bucketed to ET publish date.
  - **Dashboard:** an **[Outcomes] tab** (5th Screener tab, shipped 2026-06-02 — see entry below) reads this table. Still no scores/alerts *changed* by it — acting on the numbers waits for ~2 weeks of go-forward depth. An "exit-assist" (pullback signals: topping tails, MACD roll, red-volume spike) on the selected name is a candidate next step, not built.
  - **Status:** `/health` → `outcomes`. Verify/query via the "Reading the outcome data" block under Operational notes.
- **Outcomes / backtest tab (2026-06-02).** A 5th Screener tab `[Momentum] [Continuation] [Swing] [History] [Outcomes]` — the interactive read of `screener_outcomes` (the psql breakdowns turned into UI). Controls: **Group-by** (catalyst direction / urgency / shelf / score bucket / entry-extension / screen) × **Horizon** (1/3/5d) × **Screen** (all/mom/ign/swing); table shows per-bucket **N · avg chg · avg peak (best case) · avg drawdown (worst case) · win-rate**, sortable. `GET /api/screener/outcomes-summary` — one aggregation gated on `bars_forward >= horizon`, server-controlled CASE per group_by (zod enum), coverage header (total/ready). `OutcomesPanel.tsx`. **Anti-overconfidence by design:** N is prominent, thin buckets (<10) dimmed + ⚠, and a banner warns while horizon-ready coverage is shallow (<200) — early numbers are a direction check, not a verdict. Read-only; does not change any score/alert. Verified on prod across all group-bys + 400 on bad params.
- **News windows widened to 7 days (2026-05-31).** A second, distinct news-visibility bug from the DBGI one. AGPU was on the Continuation list with its news already in the DB (latest 05-27 "$43M payment", 05-26 Q1 call) — but viewed on Sunday 05-31 it showed no news, because the windows were too narrow to reach back across a weekend: the Continuation badge looked back only 3 days (`NEWS_LOOKBACK_DAYS`) and the click surfaces 4 (`days=4`), both excluding 05-27 (4 calendar days back). Fix: couple each surface's news window to its analytical horizon — `continuation.ts` `NEWS_LOOKBACK_DAYS → LOOKBACK_DAYS` (7, so the badge spans the same window the continuation does), and `WATCHLIST_NEWS_DAYS` / `TICKER_NEWS_DAYS` (Quote Details) / `MODAL_NEWS_DAYS` (catalyst modal) all 4→7. Verified on prod: `GET /api/news?ticker=AGPU&days=4` → 0 articles (the bug), `days=7` → 3 (fixed; the 05-27 + 05-26 items surface). Deliberately did **not** add a fallback-to-latest — a "Recent News" panel surfacing month-old news would mislead; >7-day-stale is genuinely no recent news.
- **On-demand per-ticker news (2026-05-31).** The poller only ingests news for tickers **currently in the screener universe** (it builds the news-fetch ticker list from the live screens). So a name that drops off the screens — DBGI, last screened 05-27 — or any watchlist ticker that isn't actively screening stops accruing news in our DB, even though Finviz/Yahoo/Benzinga still carry fresh items. That's why DBGI showed no news in the dashboard while Finviz/Benzinga had it. Fix: new `services/ticker-news.ts` `fetchAndStoreTickerNews(ticker)` pulls a single ticker's recent **multi-day** news live (Finviz with the date filter off → multi-day window, plus Yahoo), upserts into `news_articles` + `news_ticker_links` (dedup by url, same shape as the poller's persist path), and rule-classifies each new article. Rate-bounded by a 2-min per-ticker cache so rapid clicks don't hammer Finviz. `GET /api/news?ticker=X` now calls it best-effort *before* the DB query, so clicking any ticker's news — Quote Details "Recent News" and the catalyst modal, both already on `days=4` — surfaces the last few days regardless of whether the ticker is screening. Verified on prod: DBGI went from 2 stale rows (a 05-21 halt + a 05-11 blurb) to 41 after one read, pulling its actual recent Finviz/Yahoo PRs (05-28 AI-strategy, 05-21 partnership, 05-12 guidance, …).
- **Watchlist v2 — star-from-anywhere + news indicator (2026-05-31).** Reworked the watchlist from the initial add-form version. Capture is now a one-click **★** (`common/WatchlistStar.tsx`) on every row surface — Momentum / Swing / Continuation tables, the Ignition sidebar, and the Quote Details header — so a ticker goes on the list from wherever you spot it; filled gold = on the list (click removes), hollow = add. Default expiry dropped to **+2 ET days** (editable per row via an inline Popover DatePicker on the days-left chip; `PATCH /api/prefs/watchlist/:ticker`). Each watchlist row now surfaces its most recent catalyst (shared `CatalystBadge` + headline, 4-day news window like Continuation) **and a 🆕 "new news" dot** when an article landed after you added / last viewed the entry — so a catalyst breaking while a ticker sits in the list lights up on its own (the panel refetches every 5 min). Opening the row's news clears the dot (`user_watchlist.news_seen_at` column + `POST /api/prefs/watchlist/:ticker/seen`; the GET computes `has_new_news = latest published_at > coalesce(news_seen_at, created_at)`). The add-form and free-text notes were removed (the `note` column stays in the DB, unused). Added a `patch()` method to the web api client. Verified on prod: star-add → +2d default, list carries catalyst + `has_new_news`, mark-seen flips it to false, PATCH expiry, delete.
- **Watchlist / favorites with expiry (2026-05-31).** A persistent, per-user watchlist for the "park a ticker while the market's closed, analyze it, enter at the open" workflow. Each entry = ticker + free-text note (the thesis) + an expiration date. Expired entries auto-remove server-side via an ET-day cleanup on GET (same pattern as `user_hidden_tickers`), so the list stays trimmed to what's still live with no manual housekeeping. Always-visible **WatchlistPanel** stacked under the Ignition sidebar in the left rail (vertical split, ~35% default) — both visible while scanning the screener tabs. Add form prefills the ticker from the current selection + a note + an expiry DatePicker (default +7d, past dates disabled); list shows note + a colour-tiered days-left badge; clicking a row drives the shared selection (charts + Quote Details), × removes. `db/migrations/…_user_watchlist.sql` (PK `(user_id, ticker)` so re-adding updates note/expiry), `/api/prefs/watchlist` GET/POST/DELETE, `useWatchlist` hook, `WatchlistPanel.tsx`. Verified on prod: add → 201, past-expiry → 400, list/delete/expiry-cleanup all correct.
- **Per-ticker news — multi-day lookback (2026-05-30).** `GET /api/news?ticker=X` was hard-scoped to today (ET), so a Continuation/Swing name whose catalyst landed yesterday showed "No news yet" in both the Quote Details "Recent News" section and the catalyst modal — even with the news in the DB (STG: $50M buyback + asset disposal, all 05-29, viewed 05-30 with the market closed → today=0, 4-day window=5, verified on prod). Today-only is right for a fast intraday mover but wrong for the swing timeframe, where a 2–3-day-old catalyst still drives the stock. Added an optional `?days=N` param (default `1` = today only, unchanged momentum behavior; `days=N` filters `published_at::date >= today_ET-(N-1)::int`, clamped [1,30]). Quote Details + the catalyst modal request `days=4` (today + previous 3 ET calendar days, so a Friday headline shows the next Monday); `TickerNewsList` shows `Mon DD · HH:MM` for older items and bare time for today; section renamed "News Headline" → "Recent News". **Gotcha caught in this work:** Kysely binds the interpolated `${days-1}` as an *untyped* parameter, and Postgres has no `date - unknown` operator (error 42883) — the route 500'd (→ 502) on every per-ticker news call until an explicit `::int` cast was added. The Continuation row badge already used a 3-day window in the builder, so it was unaffected. `routes/news.ts`, `api/news.ts`, `SelectedStockPanel.tsx`, `CatalystNewsModal.tsx`, `TickerNewsList.tsx`.
- **Continuation reworked — seed-both-screens + daily-bar forward-track (2026-05-30).** The original Continuation list seeded *and* tracked from `ignition_results` only, so it had two structural blind spots: (1) a Momentum-style runner (bigger float, no nano-float volume burst) never entered `ignition_results`, so it could never appear; (2) staying on the list required *re-passing the strict real-time screen filter on a 2nd day* — the exact thing the signal is meant to transcend, so a name that gapped up day-2 on calmer volume (below the relvol/change gates) silently fell off. The rebuild separates **seed** from **track**: seed = appeared in *either* screen (`screener_results ∪ ignition_results`) on any day in a 7-day window; track = each seed's subsequent days read from **`daily_bars`** (unfiltered EOD OHLCV), where a day counts ACTIVE if it hit a screen *or* the bar shows a real move (close-to-close ≥ +5% or volume ≥ 1.5× the pre-window baseline). `days_in_run` = distinct active days from the trigger; multi-day-confirmed at ≥ 2; then a **liveness gate** drops anything whose latest close has round-tripped below 50% of the run's peak close (a dead pump isn't a continuation). New columns: **Run** (days_in_run + `scr/total` subtext showing how many days a screen actually flagged vs. the daily bar carried alone), **Move** (cumulative % from the run's base close + last day-over-day), **Off peak** (liveness %, with a ⚡ when the name is live on Ignition today). Crucially this adds **zero live API calls** — `daily_bars` is kept fresh by the existing once-per-day-per-ticker `DailyBarsService`, off the poll hot path; the builder just calls `dailyBars.trackUniverse(seeds)` to extend coverage to continuation seeds. Dual-signal 🎯 alert message updated to lead with active-days + from-base move. `services/continuation.ts`, `ContinuationTable.tsx`, types.
- **History tab — shipped (2026-05-29).** Fourth tab inside the Screener panel — `[Momentum] [Continuation] [Swing] [History]`. Pick an ET trading date + Ignition or Momentum, see every ticker that appeared on that day grouped by session (PM / REG / AH / closed). Per-`(ticker, session)` row with: first → last ET time, peak runner-score (Ignition) or status (Momentum, collapsed via `coalesce(NEW > ACC > UP > NEWS)`), two-tone chg range, price range with cumulative %lift, ticks. The day's most-impactful catalyst classification rides as a clickable 🔥/✨ badge next to each ticker. Static query — no SSE, refetches on date or screen change. `GET /api/screener/history-by-day?date=YYYY-MM-DD&screen=ignition|momentum`; single `sql` template branched at the CTE level for the two source tables; day_catalyst CTE for the news join. ~600 ms on a busy day.
- **Continuation refinements — shipped (2026-05-29).** Tab order is `[Momentum] [Continuation] [Swing]` (Continuation as the bridge between intraday and multi-day). Days column sorts ASC by default so early-stage setups float to the top (5-6-day rows are already extended — CODX at day 5 was $7+, well past entry). Shared `common/TickerLinks.tsx` extracted — Finviz + TradingView icons on Momentum, Continuation, and Swing all use it. News/catalyst badge on Continuation reads off the row's own data with a **3-day lookback** (multi-day window so a catalyst from 2 days ago still surfaces); the 🚨 "this cycle" indicator stays driven by the live payload.
- **Dual-signal 🎯 Telegram alert — shipped (2026-05-29).** Fires once per ticker per ET day when a ticker on the Continuation list (≥ 2 days of Ignition history) also clears `runner_score ≥ 40` in the live cycle. The CODX-day-2/3 trigger — the *confirmation* that the move is multi-day, not just a one-session pump. Bullish-only (skips bearish catalysts and crashing moves). Lower score floor than the vanilla Ignition alert (40 vs 58) since the multi-day prior already de-risks the signal. Message leads with `Day N · score first → today` so the trajectory is immediate.
- **Continuation tab — shipped (2026-05-29).** Third tab inside the Screener panel — `[Momentum] [Swing] [Continuation]`. Surfaces every ticker that appeared in `ignition_results` on **≥ 2 distinct ET days within the last 5**, ordered by *today's-list-presence DESC* → *days_seen DESC* → *today_peak DESC*. Pure derivative of the Ignition stream — no separate scan, no new persistence. Columns: Ticker (with live shelf badge looked up from `payload.{rows,ignition,swing}`), Days seen (color-tiered), Window (`first → last` ET dates), **Score Day-1 → Today** with trajectory arrow ↑/→/↓/· (climbing = conviction growing, falling = move rolling over), Price range with cumulative %lift, and a compact **`M I S`** live-presence strip showing which of Momentum/Ignition/Swing currently flag the ticker. The CTE-based aggregation costs ~1.5 s on the prod-sized dataset, so the poller caches the result and refreshes it every ~10 min (every 30 cycles); errors keep the previous list so a transient DB blip doesn't blank the tab. The motivating insight (catching-runners.md): a name that keeps showing up in Ignition day after day isn't an intraday flicker — it's the multi-day setup that CODX/SBFM/FATN all illustrate. Click a Continuation row + look at its 1-h chart = the swing-trader's eye-line.
- **Swing screener — shipped (2026-05-29).** A separate multi-day setup screen running inside the same poll loop on a ~20-min cadence + a forced 16:30 ET post-close refresh. Different universe than Momentum/Ignition: `$2–$50`, float `5M–100M`, mcap `≥ $50M`. Score 0–100 (Trend 25 + Strength 15 + Setup 25 + Volume 15 + Catalyst 20, shelf penalty −25); setup composite = base detection + 10/5-day breakout + close-strength. Surfaced as a `[Momentum] [Swing]` tab pair in the Screener panel — Ignition sidebar stays put (different axis: real-time discovery vs daily-setup detection). Persisted to `swing_results` (one snapshot per scan, full daily-bar context frozen for backtests). Telegram `/swing` command + alerts at `score ≥ 65` with `broke_out` or a fresh bullish strong/major catalyst. Full spec: [`swing-screener-spec.md`](swing-screener-spec.md).
- **Daily-bar backfill (Phase 3b — unpaused, shipped with Swing).** New `daily_bars` table; `DailyBarsService` pulls Finviz `quote_export?p=d` at 1 req/sec, upserts via `ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE`. Backfill mode writes full ~250-bar history on first sight, refresh mode overwrites the trailing 10 bars (catches after-close corrections). Midnight ET invalidates every cached ticker so today's just-closed bar gets re-fetched. Bootstrap surface: `POST /api/screener/swing/backfill`; verify with `GET /api/screener/swing/bars?ticker=X`. Was the hard prerequisite for the Swing score — SMAs, 52w high, ATR, base/breakout detection all need ~250 days of daily OHLCV per ticker.
- **Quote Details — Ignition history sub-tab.** Per-ticker per-cycle runner-score evolution from `ignition_results` (`GET /api/screener/ignition-history?ticker=X`). Closes the UX gap where the existing History tab silently showed nothing for ignition-only sub-$1 names that never met the Momentum filter.
- **Ignition sidebar — news indicators + anchored-VWAP arrow.** Shared `CatalystBadge` (🚨 fresh / ✨ pending / 🔥-tier classified) sits next to each ticker after the shelf badge, clicking opens the same modal as the Momentum table. ▲/▼ above/below-VWAP arrow next to the change%; the VWAP is anchored to first detection today and persists across PM → regular → AH to match a chart's day-session VWAP.
- **Ignition Telegram alerts — first-detection change% cap.** `IGNITION.alert_entry_chg_max = 40` — if a ticker's first qualifying cycle is already > 40% extended, the alert is suppressed (but not added to the dedup set, so a pullback under the cap re-fires a fresh second-leg alert). Grounded in the 05-21/05-22 data: every catastrophic loser (WHLR +146→−119, FRGT +93→−104, ORIS +54→−59) entered above this cap; every winner (SBFM +3→+47, AKTX +50→+93, BIYA +30→+51) entered below.
- **Tab-title surfaces new Ignition entries** — when the tab is hidden, a new `is_new` ignition flips the title to `PNL Dash (⚡ N ignition)`. Static, doesn't downgrade an in-progress 🔥 flash, resets on tab focus. Priority chain: flash (Momentum NEW+catalyst) > ignition > static-no-news.
- **Ignition: drop score-0 rows from the broadcast** — the volume-led Finviz filter has no change% gate (volume leads price by design), so crashes and dilution-flagged names pass through; the runner-score then clamps them at 0. Those rows used to fill the sidebar bottom anyway. Now filtered at the broadcast layer: `runner_score > 0`. Cold-start fresh entries and volume-led turnarounds (which score 48+) still surface.
- **Sidebar UX cleanup** — shelf-badge popover and ignition-score breakdown now open on **click**, not hover (and stop the click from also selecting the row); sidebar ticker symbols are `TickerLink`s (click copies + toasts); per-row × hide button uses the same global `useHiddenTickers` mechanism as the Momentum table; Finviz/TradingView icon buttons added to the Quote Details header for the selected ticker.
- **CI deploy bug fix (load-bearing)** — the rollout script is piped to `ssh ... 'bash -se'` over stdin, and `docker compose exec -T` was silently consuming stdin and swallowing the rest of the script after `nginx -t`. Every deploy since the "deploy hardening" change was skipping the nginx restart **and** the migration step, yet still reporting success. Fix: `</dev/null` on every `docker compose exec` in the deploy. **Any future edits to the deploy script must keep this redirect** or the same silent truncation returns.
- **Telegram alert tuning** — three related changes bundled (the CNEY post-mortem):
  - **Momentum alerts are bullish-only** — `pushAlerts` skips bearish strong/major catalysts (dilutive offerings, SEC probes, regulatory halts). Neutral signals (T1 "news pending" halts) still alert.
  - **Volume cold-start fix** — `rel_vol_5min` is extrapolated from the oldest sample once ~75s of history exists; volume burst measurable ~80s after a ticker appears, not 5 min.
  - **Shelf penalty no longer suppresses the Ignition alert** — `pushIgnitionAlerts` tests the threshold against the score *minus* the shelf component. Dilution still ranks the row and rides as the ⚠️, but doesn't hide the ignition.
- **Session-aware Ignition filter — looser pre-market gate.** The Ignition Finviz screen now uses a relaxed current-volume floor (`sh_curvol_o100` vs the regular-session `sh_curvol_o500`) when `session === 'premarket'`. Pre-market liquidity is thin enough that a sub-2M-float pump can rip +100% before crossing 500K cumulative shares, so the standard filter gated it out until the move was largely over. The relvol > 2 gate stays the same. Came out of the WHLR post-mortem — first appeared at +146% under the old filter.
- **LLM classifier moved from OpenAI to Anthropic.** Catalyst refinement now uses Claude Sonnet 4.6 via `messages.parse()` with a Zod schema + prompt caching on the static system prompt (Sonnet's 2048-token cache minimum makes this engage out of the box). The rule engine is unchanged. Direction calls on dilution-disguised-as-PR headlines were the motivating gap. Old `openai_*` classifier values stay valid for historical rows; new rows tag `anthropic_sonnet`. Requires `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` instead of `OPENAI_API_KEY` (one migration adjusts the `news_classifications.classifier` CHECK).
- **Telegram bot — two-way commands.** The same bot that pushes alerts now answers queries from the configured chat. Long-polling via `getUpdates`; single-chat auth (`TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID`). Commands: `/ignition` and `/momentum` (current top-N), `/status` (poller health), `/ticker SYMBOL` (quick stats for one ticker), `/hidden` + `/unhide` (gated on optional `TELEGRAM_USER_ID`), `/alerts on|off` (runtime mute). New service `services/telegram-bot.ts` reads from `poller.getLastPayload()` — no DB writes except `/unhide`.
- **Ignition sidebar — New/Top split** — the sidebar now pins a "New" section above the score-ranked list: tickers that just entered the Ignition set (< 2 min), surfaced *regardless* of runner-score. Closes a blind spot — a fresh ignition's 5-min RVol isn't measurable yet, so it scored low and sank to the bottom or off the broadcast list entirely. The poller bypasses the `broadcast_n` cutoff for new rows.
- **EDGAR shelf/dilution flag (Phase 3)** — a per-ticker SEC submissions lookup (`data.sec.gov/submissions`) over a 12-month window, grading each screener name's dilution risk `shelf` / `effective` / `active`. The "pump-and-dilute kill-switch": surfaced as a tiered warning marker on Momentum + Ignition rows, a line in Telegram alerts, and a penalty in the runner-score. Catches a shelf loaded *before* the pump — which the `getcurrent` firehose (only a few hours deep) misses. A standalone background service (`shelf.ts`), rate-limited well under SEC's fair-access limit.
- **SEC EDGAR filings** as a news source — the `getcurrent` firehose matched to screener tickers via the CIK map; surfaces offerings/dilution (424B*, S-1/S-3), 8-Ks, M&A, 13D/G stakes.
- **Nasdaq trade halts** as a news source — the market-wide halt feed; a T1 ("news pending") halt scores as a major catalyst.
- **Catalyst classification** — every headline scored (impact / direction / urgency / risk flags) by a rule engine, optionally refined by an LLM; drives the 🔥 badges.
- **Catalyst news modal** — clicking a row's fire badge opens the catalyst verdict + that ticker's news.
- **Hideable chart pane** — the Charts control accepts `0`; the chart pane unmounts entirely.
- **Telegram push alerts** — server-side, 24/5, independent of any open browser. Fires for the Momentum screener (fresh news + strong/major catalyst) and the Ignition screener (runner-score ≥ 58 **or** a bullish strong/major catalyst). All triggers are direction-aware — a bearish catalyst or a crash never alerts.
- **Ignition screener (Phase 2)** — a second, volume-led Finviz screen run each cycle; a composite, **direction-aware** runner-score (a bearish catalyst or a down-move sinks the score, so crashes don't rank as ignitions); always-visible sidebar; persisted to `ignition_results` for backtesting.
- **Registration gating** — public sign-up closed unless `REGISTRATION_OPEN=true`.
- **Deploy hardening** — CI restarts nginx after rollout (kills stale-upstream 502s) and verifies migrations against the app database after `dbmate up`.

## Key decisions & trade-offs

### TradingView free embed widget

We use the public `tv.js` "Advanced Real-Time Chart" widget. Limitations driving everything chart-related:

- **One-way config only** — we pass `symbol/interval/studies` at init; we can't read user changes or receive state callbacks, so in-chart edits don't survive a refresh. Workaround: hardcoded indicators + click-out to tradingview.com.
- **`studies_overrides` for style is unreliable** — colors/`linewidth` work sometimes; input params (lengths) work consistently.
- **Auth doesn't extend to embeds** — a TV Premium account doesn't apply to the iframe.

TradingView restricts the Advanced Charts library to companies (personal use disallowed). The real alternative is **Lightweight Charts** (Apache 2.0) — see Remaining work.

**Sub-minute / Databento-fed charts — investigated 2026-06-21, deferred.** Question raised: now that we have the Databento EQUS.MINI per-second feed, can the TradingView embed show 1s/10s charts? **No, for two independent reasons.** (1) The free `tv.js` widget mounts a **closed iframe that fetches its own data** from TradingView's servers — we pass only `symbol/interval/studies` at init, with no API to inject an external feed; the embed's ~15-min delay is internal to that iframe and entirely separate from our Databento subscription. (2) The free embed's `interval` bottoms out at **1 (one minute)** — sub-minute resolutions are a paid TV Charting-Library feature regardless of data source. **The viable path** (when revisited) is **Lightweight Charts** (data-agnostic; feed it `{time, o,h,l,c}` at any granularity): our feed is `ohlcv-1s`, so aggregate 1s→10s in code (`bucket = floor(ts/10)*10`). Two caveats make it real work, not a config flip: (a) the 1s bars are **currently discarded** — `TickFeedService.onBar` → detector → drop; charting needs them captured (rolling per-symbol buffer) and streamed to the browser (the SSE channel already exists); (b) **no history without persistence** — Lightweight Charts forward-fills fine via `update()`, but a chart would start empty and fill going forward unless we keep a ring buffer / persist bars (Databento's historical API is a separate metered product). Coverage would also be limited to the subscribed universe, only while the detector runs. Verdict: worth it as a dedicated "live tick chart" for the selected ticker alongside the TV embed, but it's a build (capture → SSE → aggregate → render), so deferred.

### Single-instance poller

`PollerService` is a singleton holding cross-cycle state in API-process memory: `prevChange`, `volHistory` (1-min + 5-min RVol), `bzHeadlineCache`, the Benzinga/SEC/halt watermarks, `classificationCache`, and the Telegram alert-dedup sets. Implications:

- **All users see the same screener** — the filter is global. Fine for personal/team use.
- **Restart resets cross-cycle state** — tickers briefly re-classify `NEW`, 5-min RVol is null until samples accrue.
- **No horizontal scaling** without moving state to Redis/DB.

### Finviz `avg_volume` scale gotcha

Finviz's `v=131` `Average Volume` is an implicit-K decimal (`"42.99"` = 42,990 shares) while `Volume` is a raw count. The `numScaled` parser in `services/finviz.ts` documents this. Also: never put `Float` in the Finviz filter string — Finviz drops null-float rows; the float ceiling is post-filtered in code.

### Cycle-driven SSE replays + alert dedup

On connect, the server pushes the last cached cycle so the dashboard isn't empty for ~20s. `useScreenerAlerts` dedupes by `cycle_id` and skips the first payload so reconnects don't replay stale audio. Telegram alerts dedupe per article URL (news) / per ticker per ET day (ignition).

## Empirical session performance (2026-05-18 → 2026-05-21)

A four-day sample of `ignition_results` rows (peak chg ≥ 10%), measured by *end-of-session* P&L from first detection (`last_chg − first_chg`, accounting for drawdowns):

| Session | Profitable days | Win rate | Avg final P&L | Notes |
|---|---|---|---:|---|
| **Regular** (09:30–16:00 ET / 18:30–01:00 UTC+5) | 3 of 4 | 50–76% | +5 to +8 | Steady; one bad day (-18). Best session you can trade live in UTC+5. |
| **After-hours** (16:00–20:00 ET / 01:00–05:00 UTC+5) | 3 of 3 | 52–76% | +3 to +22 | Most profitable, but user asleep. Telegram alerts useful as overnight intel. |
| **Pre-market** (04:00–09:30 ET / 13:00–18:30 UTC+5) | 1 of 4 outlier | 14–35% | **−15 to −30** | **Consistently money-losing if held from first detection to session close.** Drawdowns swamp the upside. |

**Key takeaway:** the Ignition screener's edge lives in AH and Regular; pre-market is a buy-the-top-and-bleed pattern. Pre-market alerts still fire useful continuations (a name that rips in PM often runs further in Regular), but **holding from first PM detection through session close consistently loses money**. The `move_after = peak − first` upside metric used internally is one-sided (`max ≥ first` by construction, so it's always ≥0); to evaluate trade outcomes use `final_pnl = last − first` and `drawdown = first − floor` together.

Worked diagnostic query — per-session per-ticker outcomes with drawdown:

```sql
with rows as (
  select c.session, (c.polled_at at time zone 'America/New_York')::date et_date,
    i.ticker, c.polled_at, i.change_pct,
    row_number() over (partition by c.session, (c.polled_at at time zone 'America/New_York')::date, i.ticker order by c.polled_at) rn_asc,
    row_number() over (partition by c.session, (c.polled_at at time zone 'America/New_York')::date, i.ticker order by c.polled_at desc) rn_desc,
    min(i.change_pct) over (partition by c.session, (c.polled_at at time zone 'America/New_York')::date, i.ticker) min_chg,
    max(i.change_pct) over (partition by c.session, (c.polled_at at time zone 'America/New_York')::date, i.ticker) peak_chg
  from ignition_results i join screener_cycles c on c.id = i.cycle_id
  where c.polled_at > now() - interval '6 days'
)
select et_date, session, ticker,
  max(change_pct) filter (where rn_asc = 1)  as entry,
  peak_chg, min_chg as floor,
  max(change_pct) filter (where rn_desc = 1) as last_chg,
  max(change_pct) filter (where rn_asc = 1) - min_chg as drawdown,
  max(change_pct) filter (where rn_desc = 1) - max(change_pct) filter (where rn_asc = 1) as final_pnl
from rows
group by et_date, session, ticker, peak_chg, min_chg
having peak_chg >= 10
order by et_date, session, peak_chg desc;
```

## Remaining work / roadmap

**Next-session orientation — the actionable items live under "Tuning from data"
below.** Building has largely caught up to the spec; the gap is grading the
shipped alerts/scores against actual outcomes so the thresholds and weights
can be retuned from real distributions rather than first-pass guesses. The
shipped pipeline is dense enough now that adding more features without that
feedback loop will be wasted work.

### Tuning from data (priority — earliest valuable work for a continuing session)

- ✅ **Forward outcome tracking** — SHIPPED 2026-06-02 (`services/outcomes.ts`,
  `screener_outcomes` table). Daily post-close job (16:30 ET, fired from the
  poller; boot-time catch-up backfills history) that rolls each ET day's
  Momentum / Ignition / Swing detections to **one row per (screen, ticker,
  et_date)** and joins `daily_bars` forward for `chg_1d/3d/5d`, `peak_5d`,
  `drawdown_5d`, anchored to the detection-day close. Idempotent upsert that
  revisits each row until `bars_forward >= 5`. Entry context denormalized
  (entry_score, first/peak_change_pct, catalyst from the news join,
  shelf_level, sessions). Zero new live API calls — reads `daily_bars` and
  `trackUniverse()`s detected tickers so nano-caps off the Swing universe get
  backfilled. **"Did the score/catalyst/shelf predict the move?" is now one
  GROUP BY.** See the worked queries in "Reading the outcome data" below.
  Status on `/health` → `outcomes`. **Still headless — no UI yet (by design:
  measure first).**
- **Retune scores from outcomes** — once outcome data has a couple of weeks
  of GO-FORWARD depth (not just the boot backfill), regress final P&L against
  each component-score bucket. Most likely candidates: Swing `Catalyst 20`
  weight, Ignition `change_score` (PM-fade → steeper penalty on extended PM
  entries), dual-signal `min_ignition_score = 40`. **Do not retune off the
  first backfill — samples are tiny and rows overlap across screens.** First
  reads (2026-06-02, small N, directional only): bearish catalyst reliably
  bad (≈ −15% 5d); bullish-catalyst names have the HIGHEST peak but give it
  back by close (the "trade the spike, don't hold" signature — endorses the
  exit-into-strength play); `active` shelf had the best mean return + worst
  drawdown (so "skip effective shelves" is NOT supported as a return filter —
  dilution = volatility, not lower upside); drawdown rises cleanly with entry
  extension.
- **Dual-signal alert outcome study** — separate forward-track. The 🎯
  alert is the highest-conviction signal we ship; its hit rate over the
  next 1, 3, 5 trading days is the most important number to know.
- **PM-specific alert handling** — see the §"Empirical session performance"
  analysis above. The Ignition PM hit rate is materially below Regular;
  the right next move is raising the PM alert threshold (or attaching a
  "PM entry recommendation" flag tied to `entry_change_pct < ceiling`).

### Runner-detection roadmap — see [`catching-runners.md`](catching-runners.md)

- **Phase 3 — refinements.** Fully shipped.
  - ✅ **EDGAR shelf/dilution flag** — a 12-month per-ticker SEC submissions lookback grades each name `shelf` / `effective` / `active`; surfaced on rows + alerts and penalised in the runner-score (`services/shelf.ts`).
  - ✅ **Phase 3b — Finviz daily-bar backfill** (was paused; shipped 2026-05-29 alongside the Swing screener). `daily_bars` table + `DailyBarsService` keeps ~250 bars/ticker fresh against `quote_export?p=d`. Repeat-runner prior is the next analytical lift — `historical_runs` per ticker is one SQL query off the backfilled data.
- **PR-wire news source** — GlobeNewswire / ACCESSWIRE firehose matched against the live screener universe. The deliberately-deferred follow-up to EDGAR + halts.

### Swing screener — deferred / tuning

- Swing filter is a code constant (`SWING.filter`) — wire to the existing Filters dialog for per-user override, mirroring the Momentum path.
- No backtest UI — `swing_results` records the score + daily-bar context with each scan; tuning is ad-hoc psql. A query view/endpoint over the score-vs-N-day-outcome would close the loop.
- **Retune from data** — the `swing_score ≥ 65` alert threshold and the §3 component weights are first-pass estimates. After 5–10 trading days of `swing_results`, retune against the actual score-vs-outcome distribution.
- **Forward outcome tracking** — schedule a daily job at 16:30 ET that joins each prior swing snapshot to today's bar, computes `chg` / `peak` / `drawdown` over N days, and writes back a `swing_outcomes` row. Makes "did the score predict the move?" a single query.
- **Sector-strength bonus** — the spec §3 reserves space for a sector-regime input (e.g. SPY/QQQ above SMA20 = risk-on, sector ETF above its 50-SMA = sector tailwind). Currently 0.
- ✅ **Dual-signal 🎯 Telegram alert** (shipped 2026-05-29) — fires once per ticker per ET day when a Continuation candidate (≥ 2 days of Ignition history) also clears `runner_score ≥ 40` in the live cycle. `pushDualSignalAlerts()` in `poller.ts`; message leads with "Day N · score first→today" so the multi-day context is immediate.

### Ignition screener — deferred / tuning

- Ignition filter is a code constant — make it user-editable, like the Momentum filter dialog.
- No backtest UI — tuning the runner-score is ad-hoc psql for now; a query view/endpoint would close the loop.
- **Retune from data** — the alert threshold (currently 58) and the runner-score weights are first-pass estimates. After several sessions of `ignition_results`, retune both against the actual score-vs-outcome distribution.
- **PM-specific alert handling** — given the empirical-findings section above (PM is consistently money-losing on hold-to-close), consider either raising the alert threshold during `session === 'premarket'` (e.g. require runner_score ≥ 65), or suppressing PM alerts entirely for the user with `TELEGRAM_USER_ID` set, or adding a separate "PM entry recommendation" flag that only fires when `up_after` is plausibly still ahead (e.g. first_chg below some ceiling).
- **LLM classifier cache verification** — check `usage.cache_creation_input_tokens` vs `cache_read_input_tokens` from the Anthropic SDK after a few classifications; if reads stay 0, the system prompt is under Sonnet's 2048-token cache minimum and we should pad it with more worked examples (also improves quality).
- **`regulatory_approval` catalyst type** — the SBFM Health Canada amoxicillin case (May 21) classified as `fda_clinical` because the schema doesn't have a separate bucket for non-FDA drug approvals. Adding it to the Zod enum + system prompt is a one-line change; no DB migration (catalyst_type is unconstrained `text`).

### Continuation / Dual-signal — deferred / tuning

- **`/dual` Telegram command** — answer with the current Continuation ∩ live Ignition intersection on demand, same shape as `/swing` / `/ignition` / `/momentum`. Mirrors the dual-signal alert criteria.
- **🎯 visual marker in the dashboard** — show on Continuation rows that *currently* qualify (dual-signal active), even if not freshly alerted. Either a column or a separate badge in the existing M/I/S live-presence strip.
- **Cache cadence retune** — `CONTINUATION_REFRESH_CYCLES = 30` (~10 min) is a guess at the right cost/freshness balance. The refresh now does the union-of-both-screens day rollup *plus* a `daily_bars` read for every seed, so it's heavier than the old ignition-only aggregation; an index on `screener_cycles((polled_at at time zone 'America/New_York')::date)` would let the cadence drop.
- **News window** — currently 3 days (`NEWS_LOOKBACK_DAYS`). Once outcome data exists, check whether 2 days / 5 days correlates better with successful Continuation trades.
- **Forward-track thresholds** — the rebuilt builder has several first-pass knobs to tune against outcomes: `LOOKBACK_DAYS = 7` (seed window), `ACTIVE_UP_PCT = 5` / `ACTIVE_RVOL = 1.5` (what counts as a bar-derived active day), `LIVENESS_MIN_FRAC = 0.5` (drop a name once it round-trips below 50% of its run's peak close). All in `services/continuation.ts`.

### History tab — follow-ups

- **Daily summary header** — top-of-day stats (total tickers, busiest session, biggest mover by chg, biggest mover by score). Visible at a glance without scrolling the table.
- **Cross-day diff** — checkbox to highlight tickers that also appeared on the *previous* ET trading day. Visual continuation hint — every name highlighted has a built-in Day-N story.
- **Date range / heatmap** — pick a 5–7 day window, get a heatmap of which tickers appeared in which (date, session) cells. Surfaces the multi-day pattern that the single-day view can only hint at.
- **Per-session filter chip** — quick "show only PM rows" without sort gymnastics.

### Dashboard / smaller items

- **Filter presets UI** — the table + `/api/prefs/filters` exist; wire a save/load-named-presets UI.
- **Cycle history / news retrospective view** — browse persisted cycles; "which source/type preceded the biggest moves."
- **Technical fields (Finviz v=171)** — RSI / Beta / ATR / SMAs; adds a Technical section + sortable RSI.
- **Per-user panel layout persistence** — currently localStorage; wire fully to `/api/prefs/layout`.
- **Per-user filter scoping** — the poller runs one global filter; per-user subscriptions need Finviz rate-limit headroom.

### Infrastructure

- **GitHub Actions Node 20 deprecation** — `actions/checkout@v4` et al. run on Node 20; bump the action versions before GitHub forces Node 24 (mid-2026).
- **Lightweight Charts migration** (large, ~3–4 days + a data add-on) — replaces the TradingView free embed with a self-rendered chart: true seconds candles, full state persistence (drawings/indicators/zoom), free of TV's licensing.

## Known limitations / caveats

- **The filter is global**, not per-user.
- **Old DB rows** from pre-migration cycles show `—` for fields added later; new rows are correct.
- **Pre-market often returns zero Momentum rows** — Finviz's `change ≥ 20%` filter is rarely met before the open. Normal. (The Ignition screen, being volume-led, surfaces names earlier.)
- **Yahoo RSS coverage for micro-caps is sparse** — the multi-source stack mitigates by treating each source as additive.
- **Deploy `.env` is manual** — the CI deploy ships code + migrations but never `.env`; new env vars must be added to the droplet by hand.

## Operational notes

### When you need to restart

| Change to | Restart? |
|---|---|
| Migration applied | No — next poll picks it up |
| `apps/api/src/**` (dev) | `tsx watch` auto-reloads |
| `apps/web/src/**` (dev) | Vite HMR |
| `.env` change | Manual API restart / `docker compose up -d` |

### Common diagnostics

```bash
# Recent cycles
source .env && psql "$DATABASE_URL" -c \
  "select polled_at, row_count from screener_cycles order by polled_at desc limit 10;"

# Ignition candidates by runner-score
source .env && psql "$DATABASE_URL" -c \
  "select ticker, runner_score from ignition_results order by created_at desc limit 25;"

# Swing screener — current top setups (latest scan)
source .env && psql "$DATABASE_URL" -c \
  "select ticker, swing_score, in_base, broke_out, close_in_top_q from swing_results \
   where created_at > now() - interval '30 min' order by swing_score desc limit 20;"

# Daily-bar reservoir depth — how many bars per ticker we have
source .env && psql "$DATABASE_URL" -c \
  "select count(distinct ticker) as tickers, count(*) as bars, \
   min(date) as oldest, max(date) as newest from daily_bars;"

# Continuation SEEDS — distinct ET screen-days per ticker over the last 7,
# unioned across BOTH screens (Momentum + Ignition). This is the seed set;
# the live tab then forward-tracks each via daily_bars (active days, liveness),
# so the tab is stricter than this raw rollup. See services/continuation.ts.
source .env && psql "$DATABASE_URL" -c \
  "with recent as ( \
     select i.ticker, (c.polled_at at time zone 'America/New_York')::date as et_date, i.runner_score \
       from ignition_results i join screener_cycles c on c.id = i.cycle_id \
       where c.polled_at > now() - interval '7 days' \
     union all \
     select s.ticker, (c.polled_at at time zone 'America/New_York')::date as et_date, null::numeric \
       from screener_results s join screener_cycles c on c.id = s.cycle_id \
       where c.polled_at > now() - interval '7 days' \
   ) select ticker, count(distinct et_date) screen_days, max(runner_score) peak_ig_score \
     from recent group by ticker having count(distinct et_date) >= 2 \
     order by screen_days desc, peak_ig_score desc nulls last limit 20;"

# News ingest by source

```

### Reading the outcome data (`screener_outcomes`)

The forward-outcome instrument (shipped 2026-06-02, `services/outcomes.ts`).
Always gate on `bars_forward >= 5` so you only compare rows whose 5-day
horizon has actually filled. **Caveat that matters: the boot backfill is ~2
weeks, samples per cell are small, and the same runner appears across multiple
screens (rows are NOT independent) — treat early reads as a direction check,
not a verdict. Wait for ~2 weeks of GO-FORWARD depth before retuning weights.**

```bash
source .env

# Coverage — how much is ready per screen
psql "$DATABASE_URL" -c \
  "select screen, count(*) n, count(*) filter (where bars_forward>=5) ready, \
   round(avg(chg_5d),1) avg5, round(avg(peak_5d),1) peak, round(avg(drawdown_5d),1) dd \
   from screener_outcomes group by 1 order by 1;"

# THE core hypothesis — does catalyst direction predict the 5-day move?
psql "$DATABASE_URL" -c \
  "select screen, coalesce(catalyst_direction,'(none)') dir, count(*) n, \
   round(avg(chg_5d),1) avg5, round(avg(peak_5d),1) peak, round(avg(drawdown_5d),1) dd \
   from screener_outcomes where bars_forward>=5 group by 1,2 order by 1, avg5 desc nulls last;"

# Shelf level — settles 'is it OK to skip effective shelves?'
psql "$DATABASE_URL" -c \
  "select coalesce(shelf_level,'(none)') shelf, count(*) n, round(avg(chg_5d),1) avg5, \
   round(avg(peak_5d),1) peak, round(avg(drawdown_5d),1) dd \
   from screener_outcomes where bars_forward>=5 group by 1 order by avg5 desc nulls last;"

# Entry-extension bucket — the WHLR/FRGT 'entered already extended' loser-trait
psql "$DATABASE_URL" -c \
  "select case when first_change_pct>=40 then 'd_>=40%' when first_change_pct>=20 then 'c_20-40%' \
          when first_change_pct>=0 then 'b_0-20%' else 'a_<0%' end bucket, \
   count(*) n, round(avg(chg_5d),1) avg5, round(avg(drawdown_5d),1) dd \
   from screener_outcomes where bars_forward>=5 and first_change_pct is not null group by 1 order by 1;"
```

**First reads (2026-06-02, small N — directional only):** bearish catalyst
reliably bad (≈ −15% 5d, worst drawdowns); **bullish-catalyst names show the
HIGHEST peak but give it back by close** — the "trade the spike, don't hold 5
days" signature, which *endorses* the exit-into-strength play rather than
refuting "catalyst matters"; `active` shelf had the *best* mean return + worst
drawdown (so "skip effective shelves" is NOT a return filter — dilution =
volatility, not lower upside); drawdown rises cleanly with entry extension.
"(none)" catalyst is contaminated — it means "no article we captured/classified
that day," not "no news."

### Migrations

The poller's column writes match `apps/api/src/db/types.ts`. Bumping those types without a matching migration causes `column "X" does not exist` errors in the poll cycle. The CI deploy runs `dbmate up` and verifies the schema against the app database; if it reports a schema behind, apply manually on the droplet with `dbmate up`.

### Deploy-script stdin footgun (fixed, but don't reintroduce)

The rollout step in `.github/workflows/build-images.yml` pipes the deploy script to `ssh ... 'bash -se'` over stdin. Any `docker compose exec -T <svc> <cmd>` inside that script will consume bash's stdin (the script body itself) and silently truncate the rest of the deploy — bash hits EOF and exits 0, the workflow reports success, but the nginx restart and `dbmate up` never ran. This was caught after the EDGAR shelf migration's CI run reported success but the column didn't actually exist on the droplet.

**Every `docker compose exec` in the deploy script must end with `</dev/null`.** Two call sites exist today (the nginx `nginx -t` check and the migration-verification `psql ... select count(*) from schema_migrations`) — both are redirected. If you add a third, add `</dev/null` or you'll reintroduce the silent-truncation bug.
