# CLAUDE.md

Project: a real-time low-float momentum screener with a multi-panel web dashboard. The original implementation is a bash script (`screener-poll_breakout.sh`) — it stays as-is. The web port lives in `apps/api` (Express + Kysely + Postgres) and `apps/web` (React + Antd + Vite). Multi-user with JWT auth.

The web service runs a singleton `PollerService` that does the same Finviz + Yahoo + Benzinga work as the bash script (plus SEC EDGAR filings and Nasdaq trade halts), persists every cycle to Postgres, and pushes live deltas to the browser via SSE.

**Continuing a session? Start with [`docs/HANDOVER.md`](docs/HANDOVER.md)** — the live "where we are + what's open" layer; its **START HERE** section (top) is the current state, live features, parked components, prod config and the ranked open items. Then:

**Status & roadmap:** what's built, recent work, and what's next live in [`docs/web-dashboard.md`](docs/web-dashboard.md). The low-float runner-detection strategy and its phased plan: [`docs/catching-runners.md`](docs/catching-runners.md); the Ignition screener spec: [`docs/ignition-screener-spec.md`](docs/ignition-screener-spec.md); the in-progress multi-day Swing screener spec: [`docs/swing-screener-spec.md`](docs/swing-screener-spec.md). **The early-detection chain (📰 news radar → 🤫 quiet accumulation → 📈 EMA cross → 👀/🛰️ tick watch/confirm → screens) is documented layer-by-layer in [`docs/detection-layers.md`](docs/detection-layers.md)** — read it before touching the tick feed, the poller's tier logic, or `tier_events`. **The operator's current edge, the 📐 VWAP setup (detected by a TradingView Pine script, delivered by webhook), is documented in [`docs/vwap-setup.md`](docs/vwap-setup.md)** — read it before changing the Pine script, `routes/tv.ts`, `services/tv-setups.ts` or the 📐 setups sidebar.

## Database Schema

Postgres, migrations via `dbmate` in `db/migrations/`.

| Table | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `users` | Accounts (JWT auth) |
| `screener_cycles` | One row per poll: `polled_at`, `filter_snapshot` (jsonb), `row_count` |
| `screener_results` | Tickers seen in each cycle: `cycle_id`, `ticker`, `change_pct`, `float_m`, `price`, `volume`, `mcap`, `country`, `status` (NEW/ACC/UP/NEWS/-), `prev_change_pct` |
| `news_articles` | Deduped news: `source` (finviz/yahoo/benzinga/sec/halt), `url` UNIQUE, `title`, `published_at`, `fetched_at`, `raw` (jsonb) |
| `news_ticker_links` | M:N — `article_id`, `ticker` |
| `user_filter_presets` | Per-user saved filters: `user_id`, `name`, `filter` (jsonb), `is_default` |
| `user_panel_layout` | Per-user panel sizing/visibility: `user_id`, `layout` (jsonb) |
| `user_chart_prefs` | Per-user chart slots: `user_id`, `slot` (1..4), `ticker`, `interval` |
| `user_edge_presets` | Per-user/per-ticker Edge rules: custom EMA pair, proximity and bailout buffers, alert switches |
| `edge_bars_1m` | Small shared 1-minute warmup store for saved Edge tickers only (not the parked global technical universe) |
| `edge_events` | Durable Armed/Entry/Bailout transitions with indicator snapshot for review and later journal attribution |
| `broker_imports` | Per-user uploaded broker statement (IBKR `.tlg`): `account`, `file_hash`, period, fill counts |
| `app_settings` | Small global key/value settings (`key` PK, `value` jsonb): `tv_alert_stages` = the 📐 stages that get announced |
| `trade_executions` | Per-user broker fills: `exec_id` (UNIQUE per user — idempotent re-import), `symbol`, `side`, signed `quantity`/`amount`, `commission`, `executed_at` (ET wall clock), `et_date`. Round-trip *trades* (flat-to-flat, P&L by exit date) are derived in `services/ibkr-tlg.ts`, not stored. Powers the `/journal` P&L calendar |

## Code Conventions

- **API responses:** `{ data: ... }` for success, `{ error: ... }` for failure
- **DB:** `getDb()` for lazy initialization (ensures env vars loaded). For quick queries: `source .env && psql "$DATABASE_URL"`
- **Validation:** Zod schemas at route boundaries
- **Naming:** camelCase in TypeScript, snake_case in Postgres
- **Types:** Kysely `Database` interface in `apps/api/src/db/types.ts` mirrors migrations
- **Imports:** ESM only (`type: module`); local imports keep the `.js` extension at runtime (`import x from './foo.js'`)
- **Frontend state:** TanStack Query for server state; React Context only for cross-cutting concerns (auth)

## Polling architecture (how the web service replicates the bash script)

`apps/api/src/services/poller.ts` is a long-lived singleton. On API startup it begins a 20s loop:

1. Fetch Finviz `v=131` (ownership: gives float, mcap, price, change, volume) **and** `v=110` (overview: gives country) in parallel. Join by ticker. Post-filter `float < FLOAT_MAX_M` (default 35M). Every 3rd cycle (~1 min) one more batched `v=152` quote covers today's 📐 setup tickers that aren't on the screen (`payload.tv_quotes`, for the 📐 sidebar's change %).
2. Per cycle, fetch news from five sources:
   - **Finviz** `news_export?v=3&t=<batch>` — one call for all current tickers, today only
   - **Yahoo RSS** `feeds.finance.yahoo.com/rss/2.0/headline?s=<ticker>` — per-ticker fan-out, today only
   - **Benzinga delta** `api.benzinga.com/api/v2/news?updatedSince=<watermark>` with `Accept: application/json` header — only articles with `ts > stored_max` count as "fresh" (audio-worthy)
   - **SEC EDGAR** `browse-edgar?action=getcurrent` — the "latest filings" firehose (one call), matched to screener tickers via the `company_tickers.json` CIK map. Surfaces offerings/dilution (424B*, S-1/S-3), 8-Ks, M&A, and 13D/G stakes. Watermark = filing dissemination ts.
   - **Nasdaq trade halts** `nasdaqtrader.com/rss.aspx?feed=tradehalts` — the market-wide halt feed (one call), filtered to screener tickers. A T1 ("news pending") halt scores as a major catalyst. Watermark = halt ts.
3. Merge precedence (highest wins): **halt > sec > Benzinga > Yahoo > Finviz**
4. Cross-cycle state lives in service memory (per-ticker `prev_change_pct`, Benzinga headline cache, three ts watermarks — Benzinga / SEC / halt). Auto-cleared at midnight ET.
5. Classify rows: `NEW` (first appearance), `ACC` (`change% delta > 2`), `UP` (any positive delta), `NEWS` (no movement but has today's news).
6. Persist cycle + rows + new news articles to DB.
7. Broadcast a delta payload to all connected SSE clients on `/api/screener/stream`.
8. Opportunity alerts (`services/opportunity-alerts.ts`, 2026-10-01): one engine decides 🅰️ first A+ of the day / ⚡ fast move / 📰 fresh headline per cycle; the same set goes to Telegram (if `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` + `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID` are set; per-kind mutes via `ALERTS_DISABLED`) and to the dashboard via `payload.alerts`. Dedup state is seeded from `tier_events` (tier='alert') and recent `news_articles` on boot, so deploys don't re-ping. The older fresh-catalyst push (`momentum` slug) still exists but stays muted in prod — the 📰 alert supersedes it. A fourth kind arrives between cycles (2026-10-03): 📐 `tv_setup`, the operator's VWAP setup detected by TradingView itself (Pine script `apps/web/src/tv/mvwap-bb-setup.pine` run as two watchlist alerts, 1m and 2m; offline replay in `apps/api/scripts/research/vwap-setup/`) and posted to `POST /api/tv/webhook` (`routes/tv.ts` → `services/tv-setups.ts` → `poller.deliverTvSetup`); it is stored as `tier_events` tier='alert' event='tv_setup', pushed over SSE as an `alert` event and shown in the 📐 setups sidebar (the left rail, `TvSetupsSidebar.tsx`). Which stages are announced is a global setting, the ⚙ menu's **📐 Stages that alert** (`GET/PUT /api/tv/settings`, `app_settings` key `tv_alert_stages`; default READY / GO / PULLBACK on, FORMING / BROKEN / HELD off — the operator hides those markers; hiding a marker on the chart doesn't stop its alert). A switched-off stage, and any READY after a ticker-line's first of the ET day, is stored but never announced; a switched-off stage is also hidden from the sidebar list (2026-10-05/06). Since script v10 (2026-10-05) the same script also carries a second setup, PULLBACK: after a fast run, price comes back to the session, month or (v14) year VWAP (stages PULLBACK / BROKEN / HELD; `docs/vwap-setup.md` §13; measured on our data in `apps/api/scripts/research/vwap-pullback/`). Since v11 the reclaim setup runs on the month and the year VWAP (a live trial for the year line); since v14 the year line is built from this year's hourly bars (`request.security`, so every timeframe agrees) and lines that fire together are named together (`line session+month`, `month+year`, …). Keep the Pine message format and `parseTvMessage` in step (`npx tsx scripts/verify-tv-setups.ts` checks both), and the Pine logic and `pinesim.py` in step (`python3 pinesim.py` self-tests both setups).

When enabled, each cycle also runs a second **Ignition screen** alongside the Momentum one. In the default lean profile it is parked by `COMPONENTS_DISABLED`, so its fetch, score, writes, payload and UI list do not run. The same gate parks MOMO/SETUPS/EMA, Swing, Outcomes, Continuation, Edge (parked 2026-08-21 — `EdgeService` does not start and `/api/edge` answers 503), the ↑ VWAP reclaim tick layer (parked 2026-08-22 after grading as noise) and Live Ticks itself (`ticks`, parked 2026-10-01 — no Databento connection at all; the subscription is being cancelled); the shared daily-bar and technical-bar engines start only when one of their consumers is enabled. The default desk is Momentum (with the A+…D grade) + Momentum History, all Finviz-fed. See `docs/HANDOVER.md` for the current operating profile and `docs/ignition-screener-spec.md` for the preserved experiment.

A standalone `ShelfService` (`services/shelf.ts`) runs alongside the poller: for every screener ticker it does a rate-limited 12-month SEC submissions lookback (`data.sec.gov/submissions`) and grades dilution risk `shelf` / `effective` / `active` — an effective shelf is the runner's kill-switch. The flag rides on each enriched row, penalises the `runner_score`, and shows in Telegram alerts.

**Single-instance only:** the service holds cross-cycle state in memory. Don't deploy multiple replicas without moving state to Redis or DB.

## Finviz API Quick Reference

**Important:** Add `-A "Mozilla/5.0"` to curl commands to avoid blocks. Add `-L` to follow the `export.ashx` → `export` redirect (Finviz silently moved this in early 2026).

**Rate limit:** Finviz Elite's real ceiling is **~1 request/second** (measured 2026-06-11: a 2nd call 300ms after the 1st gets a 429). All API-side Finviz HTTP goes through `rateLimitGate()` in `apps/api/src/services/finviz.ts` (≥1.1s spacing) and 429s raise a typed `FinvizRateLimitError`. Keep manual curl probing under ~1/s too — hammering faster starves the live poller.

```bash
# Screen stocks (v=111 overview, v=171 technical, v=131 ownership, v=161 financial)
curl -sL -A "Mozilla/5.0" "https://elite.finviz.com/export?v=171&f=sh_price_o20,sh_price_u30,cap_midover&auth=$FINVIZ_API_TOKEN"

# Price history (daily bars only — Finviz API doesn't expose intraday)
curl -sL -A "Mozilla/5.0" "https://elite.finviz.com/quote_export?t=AAPL&p=d&auth=$FINVIZ_API_TOKEN" | tail -30

# News (batch via comma-separated tickers)
curl -sL -A "Mozilla/5.0" "https://elite.finviz.com/news_export?v=3&t=AAPL,MSFT&auth=$FINVIZ_API_TOKEN"
```

### Reliable Fetch Patterns

News and quote exports sometimes return empty on first call. Use:
- **News:** don't pipe — let it complete fully, then process
- **Quotes:** save to file then read (most reliable for large data)

```bash
source .env

# QUOTES (large data) — save to file first
curl -sL -A "Mozilla/5.0" "https://elite.finviz.com/quote_export?t=TICKER&p=d&auth=$FINVIZ_API_TOKEN" > /tmp/ticker.csv && tail -60 /tmp/ticker.csv

# MULTIPLE TICKERS — Technical
curl -sL -A "Mozilla/5.0" "https://elite.finviz.com/export?v=171&t=AAPL,MSFT,GOOGL&auth=$FINVIZ_API_TOKEN"

# MULTIPLE TICKERS — Ownership
curl -sL -A "Mozilla/5.0" "https://elite.finviz.com/export?v=131&t=AAPL,MSFT,GOOGL&auth=$FINVIZ_API_TOKEN"
```

### View Types for Screening

| View | Code | Data Returned |
|------|------|---------------|
| Overview | v=111 / v=110 | Ticker, company, sector, market cap, P/E, price, change, volume, country |
| Technical | v=171 | Beta, ATR, SMA 20/50/200, 52W High/Low, RSI, price, change, volume |
| Ownership | v=131 | Market cap, shares, insider/inst ownership & transactions, short float/ratio, **shares float** |
| Financial | v=161 | P/E, EPS, profit margin, ROE, debt/equity, dividend yield |

**Key gotcha:** No single view returns both `Float` AND `Country`. The poller calls `v=131` + `v=110` in parallel and joins by ticker.

**If a fetch returns empty:** retry without piping to `head`/`tail` first; pipe after confirming data returns.
